A bookseller in the northeast corner of\\nthe country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first\\nweek of its release. It took another six months for the bookseller to\\nunload a second copy—and that was to the same person who\\nbought the first! And who knows how long it took to sell the third.\\nBy the end of the year, it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist\\nwasn’t working. My original publisher decided to cut me loose and\\ncancelled our contract. They wiped their hands of the project and let\\nme take the book with me. I was forty-one and desperate.\\nBut I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision.\\nWhy? Because it was me in there, all of me, heart and soul. I was\\nliving my own metaphor. A man sets out on a journey, dreaming of a\\nbeautiful or magical place, in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At\\nthe end of his journey, the man realizes the treasure was with him\\nthe entire time. I was following my Personal Legend, and my\\ntreasure was my capacity to write. And I wanted to share this\\ntreasure with the world.\\nAs I wrote in The Alchemist, when you want something, the whole\\nuniverse conspires to help you. I started knocking on the doors of\\nother publishers. One opened, and the publisher on the other side\\nbelieved in me and my book and agreed to give The Alchemist a\\nsecond chance. Slowly, through word of mouth, it finally started to\\nsell—three thousand, then six thousand, ten thousand—book by\\nbook, gradually throughout the year.\\nEight months later, an American visiting Brazil picked up a copy of\\nThe Alchemist in a local bookstore. He wanted to translate the book\\nand help me find a publisher in the United States. HarperCollins\\nagreed to bring it to an American audience, publishing it with great\\nfanfare: ads in the New York Times and influential news magazines,\\nradio and television interviews. But it still took some time to sell,\\nslowly finding its audience in the United States by word of mouth,\\njust as it did in Brazil. And then one day, Bill Clinton was\\nphotographed leaving the White House with a copy. Then Madonna\\nraved about the book to Vanity Fair, and people from different walks\\nof life—from Rush Limbaugh and Will Smith to college students and\\nsoccer moms—were suddenly talking about it.\\nThe Alchemist became a spontaneous—and organic—\\nPhenomenon. The book hit the New York Times bestseller list, an\\nimportant milestone for any author, and stayed there for more than\\nthree hundred weeks. It has since been translated into more than\\neighty different languages, the most translated book by any living\\nauthor, and is widely considered one of the ten best books of the\\ntwentieth century.\\nPeople continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist would be such\\na huge success. The answer is no. I had no idea. How could I?\\nWhen I sat down to write The Alchemist, all I knew is that I wanted to\\nwrite about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my\\ntreasure. I wanted to follow the omens, because I knew even then\\nthat the omens are the language of God.\\nThough The Alchemist is now celebrating its twenty-fifth\\nanniversary, it is no relic of the past. The book is still very much\\nalive. Like my heart and like my soul, it continues to live every day,\\nbecause my heart and soul are in it. And my heart and soul is your\\nheart and soul. I am Santiago the shepherd boy in search of my\\ntreasure, just as you are Santiago the shepherd boy in search of\\nyour own. The story of one person is the story of everyone, and one\\nman’s quest is the quest of all of humanity, which is why I believe\\nThe Alchemist continues all these years later to resonate with people\\nfrom different cultures all around the world, touching them\\nemotionally and spiritually, equally, without prejudice.\\nI re-read The Alchemist regularly and every time I do I experience\\nthe same sensations I felt when I wrote it. And here is what I feel. I\\nfeel happiness, because it is all of me, and all of you simultaneously.\\nI feel happiness, too, because I know I can never be alone.\\nWherever I go, people understand me. They understand my soul.\\nThis continues to give me hope. When I read about clashes around\\nthe world—political clashes, economic clashes, cultural clashes—I\\nam reminded that it is within our power to build a bridge to be\\ncrossed. Even if my neighbor doesn’t understand my religion or\\nunderstand my politics, he can understand my story. If he can\\nunderstand my story, then he’s never too far from me. It is always\\nwithin my power to build a bridge. There is always a chance for\\nreconciliation, a chance that one day he and I will sit around a table\\ntogether and put an end to our history of clashes. And on this day, he\\nwill tell me his story and I will tell him mine.\\n— Paulo Coelho, 2014\\nPrologue\\nTranslated by Clifford E. Landers\\nThe alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had\\nbrought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about\\nNarcissus.\\nThe alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt\\ndaily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so\\nfascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and\\ndrowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was\\ncalled the narcissus.\\nBut this was not how the author of the book ended the story.\\nHe said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest\\nappeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water,\\ntransformed into a lake of salty tears.\\n“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.\\n“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.\\n“Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for\\nthough we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could\\ncontemplate his beauty close at hand.”\\n“But . . . was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.\\n“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in\\nwonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to\\ncontemplate himself!”\\nThe lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:\\n“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was\\nbeautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I\\ncould see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”\\n“What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.\\nT\\nHE BOY’S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK was falling as the boy arrived\\nwith his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long\\nago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the\\nsacristy had once stood.\\nHe decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the\\nsheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks\\nacross it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night.\\nThere were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed\\nduring the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day\\nsearching for it.\\nHe swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he\\nhad just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would\\nhave to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made\\nmore comfortable pillows.\\nIt was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the\\nstars through the half-destroyed roof.\\nI wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same\\ndream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened\\nbefore it ended.\\nHe arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep\\nthat still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his\\nanimals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy\\nbound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past\\ntwo years, leading them through the countryside in search of food\\nand water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he\\nmuttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could\\nbe the other way around: that it was he who had become\\naccustomed to their schedule.\\nBut there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken.\\nThe boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by\\nname. He had always believed that the sheep were able to\\nunderstand what he said. So there were times when he read them\\nparts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he\\nwould tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in\\nthe fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he\\nhad seen in the villages they passed.\\nBut for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one\\nthing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village\\nthey would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only\\nonce, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry\\ngoods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in\\nhis presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the\\nboy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.\\n“I need to sell some wool,” the boy told the merchant.\\nThe shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until\\nthe afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a\\nbook from his bag.\\n“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice\\nbehind him.\\nThe girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black\\nhair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.\\n“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he\\nanswered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she\\nwas the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where\\neach day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the\\nAndalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns\\nwhere he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his\\nsheep.\\n“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.\\n“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”\\n“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”\\nThe boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid\\nresponding to her question. He was sure the girl would never\\nunderstand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her\\nbright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time\\npassed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end,\\nthat her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days.\\nHe recognized that he was feeling something he had never\\nexperienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the\\ngirl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.\\nBut finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear\\nfour sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come\\nback the following year.\\nAnd now it was only four days before he would be back in that same\\nvillage. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl\\nhad already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling\\ntheir wool.\\n“It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in other\\nplaces.”\\nBut in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that\\nshepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a\\ntown where there was someone who could make them forget the\\njoys of carefree wandering.\\nThe day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the\\ndirection of the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he\\nthought. Maybe that’s why they always stay close to me.\\nThe only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As\\nlong as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia,\\nthey would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the\\nseemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had\\nnever read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when\\nthe boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content\\nwith just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of\\ntheir wool, their company, and—once in a while—their meat.\\nIf I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one,\\nthey would become aware only after most of the flock had been\\nslaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten\\nhow to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to\\nnourishment.\\nThe boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the\\nsycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him\\nto have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to\\nfeel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the\\nwine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he\\ngathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from\\nnow, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he\\nwould not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time\\nof day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted\\nuntil nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when\\nhe thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he\\nremembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the\\ncold of the dawn.\\nWe have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was\\ngrateful for the jacket’s weight and warmth.\\nThe jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life\\nwas to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain,\\nhe knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to\\nexplain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to\\nread. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His\\nparents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of\\npride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food\\nand water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and\\ntheology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know\\nthe world, and this was much more important to him than knowing\\nGod and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his\\nfamily, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he\\ndidn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.\\n“People from all over the world have passed through this village,\\nson,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when\\nthey leave they are basically the same people they were when they\\narrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up\\nthinking that the past was better than what we have now. They have\\nblond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people\\nwho live right here.”\\n“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the\\nboy explained.\\n“Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to\\nlive here forever,” his father continued.\\n“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his\\nson.\\n“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they\\ncan afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who\\ntravel are the shepherds.”\\n“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”\\nHis father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch\\nthat held three ancient Spanish gold coins.\\n“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of\\nyour inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields,\\nand someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our\\nwomen are the most beautiful.”\\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his\\nfather’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a\\ndesire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it,\\nover dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to\\ndrink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.\\nThe horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared.\\nThe boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt\\nhappy; he had already seen many castles and met many women\\n(but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days\\nhence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another,\\nand a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to\\nlive out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could\\nsell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the\\nsea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and\\nother chances to be happy. I couldn’t have found God in the\\nseminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.\\nWhenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had\\nnever been to that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled\\nthrough those parts many times. The world was huge and\\ninexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a\\nwhile, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is\\nthat they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every\\nday. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change.\\nAll they think about is food and water.\\nMaybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven’t\\nthought of other women since I met the merchant’s daughter.\\nLooking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before\\nmidday. There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his\\nwine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for\\nhis meeting with the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the\\npossibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep,\\nhad arrived there before him and asked for her hand.\\nIt’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life\\ninteresting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun,\\nand hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa,\\nthere was an old woman who interpreted dreams.\\nThe old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it\\nwas separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads.\\nThe room’s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred\\nHeart of Jesus, and two chairs.\\nThe woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she\\ntook both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.\\nIt sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had\\nexperience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they\\nhad no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives\\ntricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil,\\nand that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their\\nmysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had\\nalways been frightened to death that he would be captured by\\nGypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took\\nhis hands in hers.\\nBut she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to\\nreassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling,\\nshowing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father\\nsilently.\\n“Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from the\\nboy’s hands, and then she fell silent.\\nThe boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and\\nthe woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.\\n“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already\\nregretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be\\nbetter to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was\\ngiving too much importance to his recurrent dream.\\n“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the\\nold woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks\\nin our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in\\nthe language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But,\\nwhichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”\\nAnother trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A\\nshepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought,\\nand that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.\\n“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I was\\nin a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play\\nwith the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the sheep\\nare afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play\\nwith them without frightening them. I don’t know why. I don’t know\\nhow animals know the age of human beings.”\\n“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get\\nback to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t\\ngive you a lot of time.”\\n“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,”\\ncontinued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by\\nboth hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”\\nHe paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the\\nEgyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.\\n“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words\\nslowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to\\nme, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as\\nshe was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both\\ntimes.”\\nThe woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his\\nhands and studied them carefully.\\n“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want\\none-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”\\nThe boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to\\nsave the little money he had because of a dream about hidden\\ntreasure!\\n“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.\\n“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your\\ntreasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”\\nThe shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to\\nswear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\\n“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can\\ninterpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel that\\nI deserve a part of what you find.\\n“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in\\nEgypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed\\nthem to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make\\nyou a rich man.”\\nThe boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek\\nout the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t\\ngoing to have to pay anything.\\n“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.\\n“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple\\nthings in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able\\nto understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn\\nother arts, such as the reading of palms.”\\n“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”\\n“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality.\\nThat’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.”\\n“And what if I never get to Egypt?”\\n“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”\\nAnd the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already\\nwasted too much time with him.\\nSo the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never\\nagain believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of\\nthings he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to\\neat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a\\nbench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had\\nbought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep\\nwere at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend.\\nThe boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made\\ntraveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t\\nneed to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the\\nsame people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary,\\nthey wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they\\nwant the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them\\nto be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear\\nidea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his\\nor her own.\\nHe decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky\\nbefore following his flock back through the fields. Three days from\\nnow, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.\\nHe started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page\\nit described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people\\ninvolved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he\\nthought, he would present one person at a time, so that the reader\\nwouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.\\nWhen he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading,\\nhe liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he\\nwelcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat\\ndown at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.\\n“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people\\nin the plaza.\\n“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted\\nto concentrate on his reading.\\nActually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the\\nmerchant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone\\nwho was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined\\nthe scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when\\nhe explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He\\nalso tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared\\nthe sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell\\nthem as if they were from his personal experience. She would never\\nknow the difference, because she didn’t know how to read.\\nMeanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a\\nconversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he\\nmight have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping\\nthat the old man would leave him alone.\\nBut the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book\\nhe was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to\\nanother bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the\\nelderly. So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first,\\nthat he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second,\\nthat if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel\\nashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.\\n“Hmm . . .” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if\\nit were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really\\nirritating.”\\nThe boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had\\nalready read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man\\nhad said, the boy still had time to change it for another.\\n“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in\\nthe world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability\\nto choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that\\neveryone believes the world’s greatest lie.”\\n“What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely\\nsurprised.\\n“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of\\nwhat’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.\\nThat’s the world’s greatest lie.”\\n“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to\\nbe a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”\\n“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”\\n“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old\\nman, meanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to\\nwant to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’s clothing was\\nstrange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those\\nparts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross\\nthe narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping\\nand chanting their strange prayers several times a day.\\n“Where are you from?” the boy asked.\\n“From many places.”\\n“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd,\\nand I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—\\nfrom a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”\\n“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”\\nThe boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask,\\nfearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the\\nplaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them\\nseemed to be very busy.\\n“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.\\n“It’s like it always has been.”\\nNo clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it\\nwere, he would already have heard of it.\\n“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.\\n“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king\\nof Salem!”\\nPeople say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better\\nto be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be\\nalone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time\\nwhen you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people, they\\nsay some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to\\ncontinue the conversation.\\n“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep\\ndo you have?”\\n“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to\\nknow more about his life.\\n“Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I can’t help you if you feel you’ve\\ngot enough sheep.”\\nThe boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was the\\nold man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the\\nconversation.\\n“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my\\nsheep and get going.”\\n“Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell\\nyou how to find the hidden treasure.”\\nThe boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was\\nclear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but the\\nold man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to\\nget much more money in exchange for information about something\\nthat didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.\\nBut before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over,\\npicked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza.\\nSomething bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the\\nboy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick\\nfor someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with his\\ncape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read\\nwhat the old man had written in the sand.\\nThere, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the\\nnames of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he\\nhad attended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which\\nhe hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.\\n“I’m the king of Salem,” the old man had said.\\n“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked,\\nawed and embarrassed.\\n“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that\\nyou have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”\\nThe boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.\\n“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when\\nthey are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.\\n“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is\\npossible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything\\nthey would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time\\npasses, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be\\nimpossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”\\nNone of what the old man was saying made much sense to the\\nboy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the\\nmerchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about\\nthat!\\n“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you\\nhow to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your\\nwill, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are,\\nor whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s\\nbecause that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your\\nmission on earth.”\\n“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of\\na textile merchant?”\\n“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is\\nnourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy,\\nand jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only\\nreal obligation. All things are one.\\n“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in\\nhelping you to achieve it.”\\nThey were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the\\ntownspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.\\n“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”\\n“Because I like to travel.”\\nThe old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at\\none corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to\\ntravel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some\\nmoney aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in\\nAfrica. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their\\nlives, of doing what they dream of.”\\n“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.\\n“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are\\nmore important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while\\nshepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their\\nchildren marry bakers than shepherds.”\\nThe boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s\\ndaughter. There was surely a baker in her town.\\nThe old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about\\nshepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their\\nown Personal Legends.”\\nThe old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page\\nhe came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as\\nhe himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all this?”\\n“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And you\\nare at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”\\n“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”\\n“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or\\nanother. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good\\nidea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things\\nto happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time\\npeople don’t realize I’ve done them.”\\nThe old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to\\nappear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner\\nhad abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years\\nhe had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of\\nthousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to\\ngive it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one\\nmore stone—just one more—he would find his emerald. Since the\\nminer had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man\\ndecided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone\\nthat rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and\\nfrustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it\\naside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it\\nfell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most\\nbeautiful emerald in the world.\\n“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,”\\nsaid the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they\\ngive up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”\\nThe boy reminded the old man that he had said something about\\nhidden treasure.\\n“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is\\nburied by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn\\nabout your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your\\nflock.”\\n“What about one-tenth of my treasure?”\\nThe old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising\\nwhat you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward\\ngetting it.”\\nThe boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth\\nof his treasure to the Gypsy.\\n“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old\\nman. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in life\\nhas its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”\\nThe old man returned the book to the boy.\\n“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I\\nwill tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”\\nAnd he vanished around the corner of the plaza.\\nThe boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to\\nconcentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old\\nman was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of\\nbread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what\\nthe old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave\\nthings as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing.\\nIf he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days\\nthinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the\\nway things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of\\nanxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the city, and\\nfound himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a\\nwindow at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that\\nEgypt was in Africa.\\n“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.\\n“Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one\\nof his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait.\\nThe idea frightened him.\\n“Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching\\nthe boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to travel.”\\nWhile standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his\\nflock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two\\nyears he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to\\nshear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the\\nsheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia.\\nAnd he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.\\nHe decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route\\npossible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his\\nreturn, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall.\\nFrom there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once\\ntold him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy\\nall of Spain.\\nHe could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including\\nthe plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I\\nmet that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a\\nwoman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the\\nold man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd.\\nThey were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and\\ndidn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep.\\nHe knew everything about each member of his flock: he knew which\\nones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now,\\nand which were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to\\nslaughter them. If he ever decided to leave them, they would suffer.\\nThe wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the\\nlevanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the\\neastern end of the Mediterranean.\\nThe levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock\\nand my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between\\nsomething he had become accustomed to and something he wanted\\nto have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as\\nimportant as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe\\nshe didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no\\ndifference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was\\nthe same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because\\npeople fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives\\nevery day that the sun rises.\\nI left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have\\ngotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get\\nused to my not being there, too, the boy thought.\\nFrom where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued\\nto come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the\\nbench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.\\n“That baker . . .” he said to himself, without completing the\\nthought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force\\non his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also\\nbrought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought\\nwith it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search\\nfor the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids.\\nThe boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he\\ncould have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him back\\nexcept himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and the fields\\nof Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend.\\nThe next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six\\nsheep with him.\\n“I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other sheep\\nimmediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a\\nshepherd, and that it was a good omen.”\\n“That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the\\nprinciple of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are\\nalmost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”\\n“Why is that?”\\n“Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal\\nLegend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”\\nThen the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that\\none was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that\\nsheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most\\nwool.\\n“Where is the treasure?” he asked.\\n“It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”\\nThe boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing.\\nBut she hadn’t charged him anything.\\n“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens.\\nGod has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to\\nread the omens that he left for you.”\\nBefore the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered\\nbetween him and the old man. He remembered something his\\ngrandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen.\\nLike crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf\\nclovers.\\n“That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts.\\n“Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”\\nThe old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he\\nsaw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with\\nprecious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on\\nthe previous day.\\nHe really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters\\nwith thieves.\\n“Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a\\nblack stone that had been embedded at the center of the\\nbreastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black signifies\\n‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the omens,\\nthey will help you to do so. Always ask an objective question.\\n“But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at\\nthe Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the\\npayment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”\\nThe boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would\\nmake his own decisions.\\n“Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and\\nnothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above\\nall, don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its\\nconclusion.\\n“But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.\\n“A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of\\nhappiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered\\nthrough the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful\\ncastle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.\\n“Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering\\nthe main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came\\nand went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra\\nwas playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters\\nof the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man\\nconversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours\\nbefore it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.\\n“The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of why\\nhe had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to\\nexplain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look\\naround the palace and return in two hours.\\n“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise\\nman, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you\\nwander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to\\nspill.’\\n“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of\\nthe palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he\\nreturned to the room where the wise man was.\\n“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries\\nthat are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it\\ntook the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the\\nbeautiful parchments in my library?’\\n“The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed\\nnothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise\\nman had entrusted to him.\\n“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the\\nwise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’\\n“Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his\\nexploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art\\non the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all\\naround him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which\\neverything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he\\nrelated in detail everything he had seen.\\n“‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the wise\\nman.\\n“Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was\\ngone.\\n“‘Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,’ said the\\nwisest of wise men. ‘The secret of happiness is to see all the\\nmarvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the\\nspoon.’”\\nThe shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old\\nking had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never\\nforget about his sheep.\\nThe old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together,\\nmade several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his\\nsheep, he walked away.\\nAt the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors.\\nFrom atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek,\\nthe king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt\\nthe levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy\\nwith their new owner and excited by so much change. All they\\nwanted was food and water.\\nMelchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of\\nthe port. He would never again see the boy, just as he had never\\nseen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee.\\nThat was his work.\\nThe gods should not have desires, because they don’t have\\nPersonal Legends. But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the\\nboy would be successful.\\nIt’s too bad that he’s quickly going to forget my name, he thought.\\nI should have repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he\\nwould say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.\\nHe looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know it’s\\nthe vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king\\nsometimes has to take some pride in himself.”\\nHow strange Africa is, thought the boy.\\nHe was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen\\nalong the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a\\ngigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few\\nhours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their\\nfaces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and\\nchanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed\\ntheir foreheads on the ground.\\n“A practice of infidels,” he said to himself. As a child in church, he\\nhad always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his\\nwhite horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these\\nkneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels\\nhad an evil look about them.\\nBesides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail,\\njust one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long\\ntime: only Arabic was spoken in this country.\\nThe owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a\\ndrink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a\\nbitter tea. The boy preferred wine.\\nBut he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to\\nbe concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go\\nabout getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough\\nmoney in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was\\nmagic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long,\\nmaybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man,\\nwith a breastplate of gold, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six\\nsheep.\\nThe old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy\\nwas crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old\\nman had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy\\nhad spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning\\nwhich path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He\\nhad discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a\\nsnake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there\\nwas water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.\\nIf God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he\\nthought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.\\n“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.\\nThe boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and\\nsomeone had appeared.\\n“How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a\\nyoung man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he\\nwas from this city. He was about the same age and height as the\\nboy.\\n“Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours\\nfrom Spain.”\\n“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And\\nask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”\\n“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The\\nreligion here forbids it.”\\nThe boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He\\nalmost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If\\nhe did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as\\npayment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man had\\nsaid about offering something you didn’t even have yet.\\n“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as\\nmy guide.”\\n“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.\\nThe boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening\\nattentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man’s\\npresence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss out on\\nan opportunity.\\n“You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man.\\n“And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have\\nenough.”\\nThe boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old\\nman, who had said that, when you really want something, the\\nuniverse always conspires in your favor.\\nHe took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young\\nman. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two\\nmen exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed\\nirritated.\\n“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to\\nleave.”\\nThe boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner\\ngrabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words.\\nThe boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign\\ncountry. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy\\noutside with him. “He wanted your money,” he said. “Tangier is not\\nlike the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.”\\nThe boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a\\ndangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.\\n“We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other, taking\\nthe money. “But I have to buy two camels.”\\nThey walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier.\\nEverywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the\\ncenter of a large plaza where the market was held. There were\\nthousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables\\nfor sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco.\\nBut the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all\\nhis money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided\\nthat would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the\\nstrange land he was in.\\n“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger\\nthan his friend.\\nSuddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most\\nbeautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in\\nsilver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones.\\nThe boy promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he\\nwould buy that sword.\\n“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said to\\nhis friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few\\nmoments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest\\nhad suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because\\nhe knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful\\nsword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn\\naround.\\nAll around him was the market, with people coming and going,\\nshouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods . . . but\\nnowhere could he find his new companion.\\nThe boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become\\nseparated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and\\nawait his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby\\ntower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their\\nknees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the chant.\\nThen, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and\\nleft.\\nThe sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through\\nits trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white\\nhouses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had\\nrisen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with\\nsixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl. That morning\\nhe had known everything that was going to happen to him as he\\nwalked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set,\\nhe was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land, where he\\ncouldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd,\\nand he had nothing, not even the money to return and start\\neverything over.\\nAll this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought.\\nHe was feeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life\\ncould have changed so suddenly and so drastically.\\nHe was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even\\nwept in front of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and\\nhe was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was\\nunfair, and because this was the way God repaid those who believed\\nin their dreams.\\nWhen I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me\\nhappy. People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But\\nnow I’m sad and alone. I’m going to become bitter and distrustful of\\npeople because one person betrayed me. I’m going to hate those\\nwho have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I’m\\ngoing to hold on to what little I have, because I’m too insignificant to\\nconquer the world.\\nHe opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions;\\nmaybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship.\\nBut all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones\\nthe old man had given him.\\nAs he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He\\nhad exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been\\ntaken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a\\nreturn ticket. But this time I’ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing\\nthem from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket. This was a\\nport town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that\\nport towns are full of thieves.\\nNow he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset:\\nhe was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone else\\n—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not\\nwhat actually does.”\\nHe ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their\\ntemperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just\\nhandling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old\\nman.\\n“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping\\nyou to achieve it,” he had said.\\nThe boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man\\nhad said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to\\nhis name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the\\nstones were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of\\nthe boy’s past.\\n“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read\\nthe omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided\\nto do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear\\nquestions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So,\\nhe asked if the old man’s blessing was still with him.\\nHe took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”\\n“Am I going to find my treasure?” he asked.\\nHe stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the\\nstones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the\\npouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that\\nthere was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and\\nThummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying\\nthere on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.\\n“Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had\\nsaid.\\nAn omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones\\nand put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending the hole\\n—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had\\nlearned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about, so as\\nnot to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I would\\nmake my own decisions,” he said to himself.\\nBut the stones had told him that the old man was still with him,\\nand that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the\\nempty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a\\nstrange place; it was a new one.\\nAfter all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new\\nplaces. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already\\ntraveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew\\nhow different things are just two hours by ship from where they are,\\nhe thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty\\nmarketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life,\\nand he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him\\na bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he\\nmused about these things, he realized that he had to choose\\nbetween thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an\\nadventurer in quest of his treasure.\\n“I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.\\nHe was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep\\nin the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to\\nresume.\\nLooking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he\\nwas in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy.\\nHe no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could\\ngo in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket,\\nbut he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be\\nas much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.\\nHe walked slowly through the market. The merchants were\\nassembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his.\\nThe candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of\\nwhat his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile\\nreminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had\\nmet. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can\\ntravel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it because it’s\\nwhat he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do\\nthe same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was\\nnear to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s\\neasy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.\\nWhen the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy\\nthe first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it,\\nand went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he\\nrealized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had\\nspoken Arabic and the other Spanish.\\nAnd they had understood each other perfectly well.\\nThere must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy\\nthought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now\\nit’s happening with people.\\nHe was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things\\nthat he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he\\nhad never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because\\nhe had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to\\nunderstand this language without words, I can learn to understand\\nthe world.\\nRelaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through\\nthe narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to\\nread the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but\\nshepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that\\nstrange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with\\nhis sheep.\\n“All things are one,” the old man had said.\\nThe crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety\\nthat he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty\\nyears: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers\\npassed. Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he\\nhad ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware. There\\nhad been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab\\nmerchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who\\nwere always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be\\nselling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and\\nhave beautiful women at his side as he grew older.\\nBut, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of\\nCeuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off.\\nNeighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops\\non the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse\\nthrough a few small shops.\\nBut the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years\\nof his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to\\ndo anything else.\\nHe spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and\\ngoings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the\\nschedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy\\nstopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the\\npracticed eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no\\nmoney to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his\\nlunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.\\nA card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages\\nwere spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the\\ncounter.\\n“I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said the\\nboy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy them.”\\nThe man looked at him without responding.\\n“In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”\\nThe man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going\\nto have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket—he\\ncertainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out,\\nhe began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the\\nglasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had\\nentered the shop and bought some crystal.\\nWhen he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for\\nsomething to eat. “Let’s go and have some lunch,” said the crystal\\nmerchant.\\nHe put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby.\\nAs they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant\\nlaughed.\\n“You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran requires\\nme to feed a hungry person.”\\n“Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.\\n“Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to\\ncleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”\\nWhen they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said,\\n“I’d like you to work in my shop. Two customers came in today while\\nyou were working, and that’s a good omen.”\\nPeople talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they\\nreally don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that\\nfor so many years I had been speaking a language without words to\\nmy sheep.\\n“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.\\n“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all\\nnight, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In\\nreturn, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”\\nThe merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an\\nentire year . . . even if you earned a good commission selling every\\npiece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There\\nare thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”\\nThere was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the\\ncity was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among\\nthe merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no\\nadventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no\\nPyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s\\nsoul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café,\\nwishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at\\nthat moment.\\nThe merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen\\nthat morning had suddenly disappeared.\\n“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country,\\nmy son,” said the crystal merchant.\\nThe boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked\\nup his pouch.\\n“I’ll work for you,” he said.\\nAnd after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy\\nsome sheep.”\\nT\\nHE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE crystal merchant for almost a\\nmonth, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that\\nwould make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day\\nmumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the\\npieces and not to break anything.\\nBut he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he\\nwas an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good\\ncommission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put\\nsome money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if\\nhe continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a\\nwhole year to be able to buy some sheep.\\n“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to the\\nmerchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people who\\npass at the bottom of the hill.”\\n“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People will\\npass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”\\n“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them\\nmight have died if we had come upon a snake. But that’s the way life\\nis with sheep and with shepherds.”\\nThe merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal\\nglasses. He was selling better than ever . . . as if time had turned\\nback to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s\\nmajor attractions.\\n“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the\\ncustomer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to\\nreturn to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”\\n“Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost\\nwithout meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because the\\nmerchant had never met the king.\\n“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because\\nlife wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had\\nsaid.\\nBut the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy’s\\nvery presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and\\nmoney was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about\\nhaving hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he\\ndeserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t\\namount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He\\nhad assumed he would soon return to his sheep.\\n“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away\\nfrom the business of the display.\\n“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered,\\nsaying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a\\npainful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.\\n“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the\\ndesert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a\\npile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”\\n“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait\\non a customer who had entered the shop.\\nTwo days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.\\n“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan,\\nthat rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect\\nhim much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”\\nThat’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.\\n“Why did you think we should have the display?”\\n“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage\\nwhen luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to\\nhelp us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”\\nThe merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The\\nProphet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy\\nduring our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true\\nGod. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan,\\nand be charitable to the poor.”\\nHe stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the\\nProphet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he\\nwanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.\\n“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.\\n“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the\\nmerchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a\\npilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy\\ncity of Mecca.\\n“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was\\nyoung, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start\\nthis shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca.\\nI began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave\\nsomeone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At\\nthe same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading\\nfor Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans\\nwith servants and camels, but most of the people making the\\npilgrimage were poorer than I.\\n“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed\\nthe symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of\\nthem, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had\\ntraveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more\\ntired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his\\nleather.”\\n“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.\\n“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s\\nwhat helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute\\ncrystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible\\ncafé. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go\\non living.\\n“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re\\ndifferent from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just\\nwant to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times\\ncrossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the\\nseven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve\\nalready imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in\\nfront of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But\\nI’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to\\ndream about it.”\\nThat day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the\\ndisplay. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same\\nway.\\nTwo more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers\\ninto the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six\\nmore months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet\\nanother sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock,\\nand he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he\\nwas now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in\\nthe marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and\\nThummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him\\nas was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy\\nin his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would\\ndisembark at Tarifa as a winner.\\n“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had\\nsaid. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was\\nhis treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a\\nthief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.\\nHe was proud of himself. He had learned some important things,\\nlike how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words . . .\\nand about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of\\nthe hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to\\nget something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to\\nrecognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.\\n“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”\\n“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.\\n“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the\\ntea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the\\ngreat seducer of men.”\\nThe merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his\\nprayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and\\nshare his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.\\n“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.\\n“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to\\nearn the money to do so.”\\nThe merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled\\ndeeply.\\n“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad,\\nand everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its\\ndimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop\\nis going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”\\n“Well, isn’t that good?”\\n“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was\\nthinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while\\nmy friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better\\nthan they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see\\nthat it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always\\nwanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t\\nknow how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”\\nThe boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You\\nhave been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I\\ndidn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t\\nwant anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth\\nand at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and\\nnow that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel\\nworse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I\\nshould be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”\\nIt’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa,\\nthought the boy to himself.\\nThey went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to\\nset. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of\\nhimself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he\\nthought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to\\nknow about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.\\nThere are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t\\nteach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they\\never do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that\\nthey were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.\\n“Maktub,” the merchant said, finally.\\n“What does that mean?”\\n“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he\\nanswered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is\\nwritten.’”\\nAnd, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy\\nthat he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes,\\nthere’s just no way to hold back the river.\\nThe men climbed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the\\ntop. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint\\ntea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful\\ncrystal glasses.\\n“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some\\ncrystal—he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests would\\nbe impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man\\nremarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in\\ncrystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a\\ntradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had\\nmagical powers.\\nBefore long, the news spread, and a great many people began to\\nclimb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a\\ntrade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in\\ncrystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little\\nbusiness.\\nEventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He\\nbegan to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal,\\nand his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for\\nthings new.\\nAnd, in that way, the months passed.\\nThe boy awoke before dawn. It had been eleven months and nine\\ndays since he had first set foot on the African continent.\\nHe dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought\\nespecially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it\\nwith a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he\\ndescended the stairs silently.\\nThe city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and\\ndrank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled\\ndoorway, smoking the hookah.\\nHe smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the\\nsound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had\\nfinished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there\\nfor a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn.\\nIt was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and\\ntwenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from\\nAfrica into his own country.\\nHe waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the\\nshop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.\\n“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy\\nmy sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”\\nThe old man said nothing.\\n“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have\\nhelped me.” The man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing.\\nThen he turned to the boy.\\n“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my\\ncrystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as\\nyou know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”\\n“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.\\n“Maktub,” said the old crystal merchant.\\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing.\\nThe boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled\\nthree sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room,\\nhis old shepherd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly\\nthought of it for a long time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch,\\nthinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the\\nfloor. Urim and Thummim.\\nIt made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize\\nhow long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year,\\nhe had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside\\nenough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.\\n“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”\\nThe boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the\\nstrange sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard\\nfor a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.\\nI’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy\\nthought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.\\nBut the sheep had taught him something even more important:\\nthat there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a\\nlanguage the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to\\nimprove things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of\\nthings accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search\\nfor something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a\\nstrange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he\\ncould conquer the world.\\n“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you\\nachieve it,” the old king had said.\\nBut the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about\\nendless deserts, or about people who know what their dreams are\\nbut don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told him that the\\nPyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in\\nhis backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have\\nenough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before,\\nyou should buy it.\\nThe boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He\\nwent down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign\\ncouple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking\\ntea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time\\nof the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that\\nthe old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king.\\nHe remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in\\nTangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go—that smile\\nhad also been like the old king’s smile.\\nIt’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought.\\nAnd yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the\\nother hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are\\ntrying to realize their Personal Legend.\\nHe left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t\\nwant to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the\\nplace and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident\\nin himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.\\n“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my\\nflock again.” He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no\\nlonger happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to\\nmake a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was\\nbecoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his\\ndream.\\nWho knows . . . maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant:\\nnever go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he\\nthought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and\\nThummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and\\nwill of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the\\nboy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day\\nthere. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of\\ntea.\\nI can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I\\nlearned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s\\ndone. But maybe I’ll never have another chance to get to the\\nPyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he\\nknew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.\\nThe hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an\\nentire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that\\nthere was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two\\nhours closer to his treasure . . . the fact that the two hours had\\nstretched into an entire year didn’t matter.\\nI know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I\\nunderstand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be\\ngood friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a\\nfriend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I\\ndon’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and\\nall the time I need. Why not?\\nHe suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to\\nbeing a shepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman\\nagain. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a\\ndream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just\\nanyone!\\nHe was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one\\nof the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means\\nof caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in\\nhis hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the\\nway to his treasure.\\n“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their\\nPersonal Legend,” the old king had told him.\\nWhat could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find\\nout if the Pyramids were really that far away?\\nThe Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of\\nanimals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never\\nthought I’d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed\\nthrough the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university,\\nand here I am in a corral.\\nBut he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all\\nhis studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the\\nuniverse. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions,\\nand now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he\\nunderstood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an\\nalchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,\\nbut his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not\\nseem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an\\nalchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only\\nabout themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who\\nknows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master\\nWork—the Philosopher’s Stone—and for this reason kept their\\nknowledge to themselves.\\nHe had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father,\\nfruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous\\namounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had\\npurchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In\\none he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist\\nhad visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred\\nyears old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and\\nthe Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by\\nthe story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth,\\nhad not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition\\nin the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of\\nexceptional powers.\\n“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people\\nsay that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any\\nmetal into gold.”\\nThe Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all\\nhis commitments and pulled together the most important of his\\nbooks, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly\\nwarehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a\\ncrossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-\\nFayoum.\\nI’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought.\\nAnd the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.\\nA young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and\\ngreeted the Englishman.\\n“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.\\n“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his\\nreading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he\\nneeded to do was review all he had learned over the years, because\\nthe alchemist would certainly put him to the test.\\nThe young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book\\nwas written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He\\nspoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-\\nFayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no\\nother important things to do.\\n“That’s strange,” said the boy, as he tried once again to read the\\nburial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to\\nread this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even\\nwithout a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to\\nconcentrate.\\nHe still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he\\nwas able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the\\nbeginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really\\ndiving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never\\ndreamed of when he first made the decision.\\nWhen I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I’d\\nwind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this\\ncaravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to\\nbe a mystery to me.\\nNearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed\\nunfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They\\nmight even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the\\nconversation.\\nThe boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything\\nthat might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and\\nThummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.\\nThe stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”\\nIn a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.\\n“They’re not for sale,” he said.\\n“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re\\nonly made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in\\nthe earth. But those who know about such things would know that\\nthose are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in\\nthis part of the world.”\\n“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.\\nThe stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket,\\nand took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.\\n“Did you say a king?” he asked.\\n“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like\\nme, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.\\n“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king\\nthat the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not\\nsurprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”\\nAnd he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he\\nwas talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me\\nabout Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of\\ndivination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden\\nbreastplate.”\\nThe boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.\\n“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.\\n“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing\\nby the moment.\\n“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing\\nthe journal he was reading. “There is a universal language,\\nunderstood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of\\nthat universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I\\nhave to find a man who knows that universal language. An\\nalchemist.”\\nThe conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.\\n“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan\\nleaving today for Al-Fayoum.”\\n“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.\\n“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are\\nyou?”\\n“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab\\nhad gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the\\nwords luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal\\nlanguage is written.”\\nHe told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with\\nUrim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too,\\nwere in search of the alchemist.\\n“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately\\nregretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach\\nany importance to it.\\n“In a way, so am I,” he said.\\n“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when\\nthe warehouse boss called to them to come outside.\\n“I’m the leader of the caravan,” said a dark-eyed, bearded man. “I\\nhold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The\\ndesert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.”\\nThere were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four\\nhundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd\\nwere women, children, and a number of men with swords at their\\nbelts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had\\nseveral suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and\\nthe leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to\\nunderstand what he was saying.\\n“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own\\nGod. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I\\nwill do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But\\nI want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in\\nthat you will follow my orders no matter what. In the desert,\\ndisobedience means death.”\\nThere was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly\\nto his or her own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The\\nEnglishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a\\nsimple vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for\\nprotection.\\nA long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up.\\nThe boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed\\nuncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s\\ncamel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.\\n“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman,\\npicking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the\\nwarehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who\\n. . .”\\nBut the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear\\nwhat the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about\\nto describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to\\nanother, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd,\\nthat had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city\\nnear Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal\\nmerchant, and . . .\\nThe closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more\\nthat Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the\\nboy.\\nThe caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the\\nmorning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late\\nin the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who\\nspent most of his time with his books.\\nThe boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and\\npeople across the desert. Now everything was quite different from\\nhow it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion\\nand shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all\\nmixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.\\nBut, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind,\\nand of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little\\nto one another.\\n“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel\\ndrivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so\\ndistant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should\\nremain silent.”\\nThe boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever\\nhaving set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a\\nfire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.\\nI’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from\\ncrystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It\\nseems old and wise.\\nThe wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had\\nsat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It\\nreminded him of the wool from his sheep . . . his sheep who were\\nnow seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they\\nalways had.\\n“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without\\nnostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have\\nprobably already forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the\\nsheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”\\nHe thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had\\nprobably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who\\ncould read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably\\nwasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding\\nof the camel driver’s comment: maybe he was also learning the\\nuniversal language that deals with the past and the present of all\\npeople. “Hunches,” his mother used to call them. The boy was\\nbeginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of\\nthe soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all\\npeople are connected, and we are able to know everything, because\\nit’s all written there.\\n“Maktub,” the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.\\nThe desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others.\\nWhen the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if\\nthere was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the\\nsand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way where\\nthe sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was\\ncovered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such\\nplaces, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden\\ntheir charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over such\\ntreacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to\\nfall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new\\none.\\nBut all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many\\ndetours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the\\nsame compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to\\nits course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis.\\nWhen the people saw that star shining in the morning sky, they knew\\nthey were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and\\nother people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all\\nthis; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.\\nThe boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the\\nfirst few days of the journey. But he found it much more interesting to\\nobserve the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had\\nlearned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with\\nhim, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed a\\nsuperstition that each time he opened the book he would learn\\nsomething important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.\\nHe became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside\\nhim. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver\\nhis adventures as a shepherd.\\nDuring one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.\\n“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my orchard, my\\nchildren, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One year,\\nwhen the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I\\nsatisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and\\nthat made me feel good.\\n“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its\\nbanks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others,\\nnever to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees\\nin the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I\\nthought that everything I owned would be destroyed.\\n“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a\\nliving. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to\\nunderstand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if\\nthey are capable of achieving what they need and want.\\n“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our\\npossessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we\\nunderstand that our life stories and the history of the world were\\nwritten by the same hand.”\\nSometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had\\nsomething that the other needed—as if everything were indeed\\nwritten by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers\\nexchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the\\ndesert.\\nAt other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were\\nBedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They\\nprovided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in\\nsilence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that\\nshowed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came to the fire\\nwhere the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are rumors of\\ntribal wars,” he told them.\\nThe three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear\\nin the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was\\nexperiencing the language without words . . . the universal language.\\nThe Englishman asked if they were in danger.\\n“Once you get into the desert, there’s no going back,” said the\\ncamel driver. “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only\\nabout the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah,\\nincluding the danger.”\\nAnd he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”\\n“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy said to\\nthe Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of\\ndetours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”\\n“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the\\nEnglishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”\\nThe immense collection of people and animals began to travel\\nfaster. The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights—\\nwhen the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires—had\\nalso become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made\\nthe decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to\\nattract attention to the caravan.\\nThe travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a\\ncircle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against\\nthe nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the\\nfringes of the group.\\nThe Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the\\nboy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the\\nencampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the\\nEnglishman the story of his life.\\nThe Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress\\nachieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.\\n“That’s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In alchemy,\\nit’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all\\nyour heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s\\nalways a positive force.”\\nHe also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on\\nthe face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or\\nanimal—or even just a simple thought.\\n“Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because\\nthe earth is alive . . . and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so\\nwe rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop\\nyou probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in\\nyour success.”\\nThe boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon\\nand the bleached sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed\\nthe desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak the same\\nlanguage, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing.\\nIt’s going to test the caravan’s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if\\nit is, we will make it to the oasis.”\\n“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal\\ncourage, but without understanding that language, this journey would\\nhave been much more difficult.”\\nThey stood there looking at the moon.\\n“That’s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the\\nguides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan\\nspeaks to the soul of the desert.”\\nThe Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention to the\\ncaravan.”\\n“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy.\\nThey were strange books. They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons,\\nand kings, and he didn’t understand any of it. But there was one idea\\nthat seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are\\nthe manifestation of one thing only.\\nIn one of the books he learned that the most important text in the\\nliterature of alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been\\ninscribed on the surface of an emerald.\\n“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he might\\nteach something to the boy.\\n“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.\\n“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman\\nanswered, without appearing really to believe what he had said.\\nThe book that most interested the boy told the stories of the\\nfamous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire\\nlives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed\\nthat, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all\\nits individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the\\nWorld. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything\\non the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all\\nthings communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—\\nit was part liquid and part solid.\\n“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand\\nthe language?” the boy asked.\\n“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the\\nEnglishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step\\nhas to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”\\nThe boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called\\nthe Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the\\nalchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone.\\n“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the\\nEnglishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories,\\nobserving the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time\\nclose to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world.\\nThey discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a\\npurification of themselves.”\\nThe boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it\\nwas a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he\\ncould free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming\\nmore and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s\\ndaily life.\\n“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a\\nfascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large\\nquantities of metal into gold.”\\nHaving heard that, the boy became even more interested in\\nalchemy. He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to\\ntransform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various\\npeople who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli,\\nand Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his\\nPersonal Legend to the end. They traveled, spoke with wise men,\\nperformed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the Philosopher’s\\nStone and the Elixir of Life.\\nBut when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master\\nWork, he became completely lost. There were just drawings, coded\\ninstructions, and obscure texts.\\n“Why do they make things so complicated?” he asked the\\nEnglishman one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was\\nirritable, and missed his books.\\n“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can\\nunderstand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around transforming\\nlead into gold. Gold would lose its value.\\n“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things\\ndeeply, who achieve the Master Work. That’s why I’m here in the\\nmiddle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to\\ndecipher the codes.”\\n“When were these books written?” the boy asked.\\n“Many centuries ago.”\\n“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy\\nargued. “There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy.\\nWhy did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”\\nThe Englishman didn’t answer him directly. He said that for the\\npast few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan\\noperated, but that he hadn’t learned anything new. The only thing he\\nhad noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more\\nfrequent.\\nThen one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman. “Did\\nyou learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it\\nmight be. He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking\\nabout the possibility of war.\\n“I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands\\nthat soul can also understand the language of things. I learned that\\nmany alchemists realized their Personal Legends, and wound up\\ndiscovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher’s Stone, and the\\nElixir of Life.\\n“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that\\nthey could be written on the surface of an emerald.”\\nThe Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the\\nmagic symbols, the strange words, and the laboratory equipment . . .\\nnone of this had made an impression on the boy. His soul must be\\ntoo primitive to understand those things, he thought.\\nHe took back his books and packed them away again in their\\nbags.\\n“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me\\nanything, either.”\\nThe boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and\\nthe sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own way of\\nlearning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine,\\nnor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal Legends,\\nand I respect him for that.”\\nThe caravan began to travel day and night. The hooded Bedouins\\nreappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver—who\\nhad become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war\\nbetween the tribes had already begun. The caravan would be very\\nlucky to reach the oasis.\\nThe animals were exhausted, and the men talked among\\nthemselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the\\nnight, when the mere groan of a camel—which before had been\\nnothing but the groan of a camel—now frightened everyone,\\nbecause it might signal a raid.\\nThe camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with\\nthe threat of war.\\n“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one\\nnight, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think\\nabout. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to\\nfight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other.\\n“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested\\nonly in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present,\\nyou’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that\\nthere are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they\\nare part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand\\nfestival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”\\nTwo nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy\\nlooked for the star they followed every night. He thought that the\\nhorizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see\\nstars on the desert itself.\\n“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.\\n“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.\\n“Because we have to sleep.”\\nThe boy awoke as the sun rose. There, in front of him, where the\\nsmall stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date\\npalms, stretching across the entire desert.\\n“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened\\nearly.\\nBut the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the\\ndesert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a\\nlong way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning\\nwould just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the party\\nthe camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as he did\\nthe lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although the\\nvision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now\\nit signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the\\ncamel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could\\nherald a miracle.\\nThe world speaks many languages, the boy thought.\\nThe times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist,\\nas he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the\\noasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the\\ndesert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with\\nexcitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the\\ntribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him\\nat length.\\nBut none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen\\nmany people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He\\nhad seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes\\nwere changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same\\nsands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed\\nseeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after\\nweeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the\\ndate palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could\\nappreciate the date trees, he thought.\\nHe decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew\\nthat in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some\\nof his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man\\nyet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared.\\nHe hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous\\napprentice.\\nI don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of\\nmouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God\\nrevealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.\\nHe had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be\\ntransmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life,\\nand this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.\\nBecause people become fascinated with pictures and words, and\\nwind up forgetting the Language of the World.\\nThe boy couldn’t believe what he was seeing: the oasis, rather than\\nbeing just a well surrounded by a few palm trees—as he had seen\\nonce in a geography book—was much larger than many towns back\\nin Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees,\\nand innumerable colored tents spread among them.\\n“It looks like A Thousand and One Nights,” said the Englishman,\\nimpatient to meet with the alchemist.\\nThey were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals\\nand people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know\\nif they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one\\nanother for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the\\nmerchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the\\ntravelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and\\nshouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found\\nthemselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved\\nand happy.\\nThey had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the\\ncamel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered\\nto be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were\\nwomen and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but\\nthe tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of\\nrefuge.\\nWith some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his\\npeople together and gave them his instructions. The group was to\\nremain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was\\nover. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space\\nwith those who lived there, and would be given the best\\naccommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that\\neveryone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the\\nmen appointed by the tribal chieftains.\\n“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “The oases\\nmay not shelter armies or troops.”\\nTo the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated\\nrevolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting\\nthe arms.\\n“Why a revolver?” he asked.\\n“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.\\nMeanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got\\nto the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It\\nseemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no\\nlonger functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being\\nconstantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he\\ncould not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively,\\nhe would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.\\nGod placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with\\nthe thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of\\nthis world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a\\njob. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by\\nGod to indicate what he should do.\\n“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel\\ndriver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time\\nto move along.’”\\nThat first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the\\nEnglishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a\\ntent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of\\nthe desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.\\nThe boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to\\ntell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman\\ncame into the tent.\\n“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy\\noutside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”\\nFirst, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would\\nprobably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of\\nthe people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was\\ncontinuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the\\noasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were\\nhundreds of tents.\\n“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, sitting\\ndown with the boy near one of the wells.\\n“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.\\nThe Englishman didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for\\nbeing at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally, he\\nagreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so.\\nThe boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a\\ngoatskin with water.\\n“Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist\\nlives here at the oasis.”\\nThe woman said she had never heard of such a person, and\\nhurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had\\nbetter not try to converse with women who were dressed in black,\\nbecause they were married women. He should respect tradition.\\nThe Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the\\nlong journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was\\nin pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such\\npursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—\\nthat’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.\\n“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no\\none here has, either.”\\nThe Englishman’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here knows\\nwhat an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’s\\nillnesses!”\\nSeveral women dressed in black came to the well for water, but\\nthe boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s\\ninsistence. Then a man approached.\\n“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the\\nboy asked.\\n“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the\\nstrangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses\\nfrom the Koran, and moved on.\\nAnother man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small\\nbucket. The boy repeated his question.\\n“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.\\n“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to\\nmeet with him,” the boy said.\\n“If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful\\none,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even\\nthe tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only\\nwhen he consents.\\n“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try\\nto enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.\\nBut the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.\\nFinally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in\\nblack. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered\\nby a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to\\nask about the alchemist.\\nAt that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the\\nSoul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark\\neyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and\\nsilence, he learned the most important part of the language that all\\nthe world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable\\nof understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than\\nhumanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the\\nsame force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at\\nthe well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he\\nhad been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The\\nomen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the\\ncrystals and in the silence of the desert.\\nIt was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation,\\njust as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.\\nWhat the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of\\nthe only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she\\nrecognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of\\nanything in the world. He had been told by his parents and\\ngrandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person\\nbefore becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way\\nhad never learned the universal language. Because, when you know\\nthat language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world\\nawaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great\\ncity. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes\\nmeet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that\\nmoment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun\\nhas been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love,\\nand creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such\\nlove, one’s dreams would have no meaning.\\nMaktub, thought the boy.\\nThe Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”\\nThe boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did\\nthe same.\\n“What’s your name?” he asked.\\n“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.\\n“That’s what some women in my country are called.”\\n“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The\\ninvaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of\\nthe invaders with pride.\\nThe Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the\\nman who cured people’s illnesses.\\n“That’s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said.\\n“He communicates with the genies of the desert.”\\nThe genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed\\nto the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then\\nshe filled her vessel with water and left.\\nThe Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And\\nthe boy sat there by the well for a long time, remembering that one\\nday in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that\\nwoman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew\\nshe existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to\\ndiscover every treasure in the world.\\nThe next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl.\\nTo his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.\\n“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with\\nthe first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked\\nme if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I\\nhad come here to learn.\\n“He told me I should try to do so. That’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”\\nThe boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all\\nthis way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had already\\ndone so many times.\\n“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.\\n“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”\\nAs the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with\\nwater.\\n“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be\\nmy wife. I love you.”\\nThe girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.\\n“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the\\ndesert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids,\\nand for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing,\\nbecause it brought me to you.”\\n“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.\\nThe boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded\\nhimself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a\\nshepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.\\n“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as\\nif she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the\\ndesert are proud of their tribesmen.”\\nShe refilled her vessel and left.\\nThe boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told\\nher about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the\\ncrystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen\\nminutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never\\npass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader\\nof the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with\\nhim.\\n“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our\\njourney,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even\\nyears. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is\\nimportant to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a\\nwar between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and,\\nwhen that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because\\nAllah is on both sides.”\\nThe people went back to where they were living, and the boy went\\nto meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’s\\nmeeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told me that you\\nloved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language\\nand the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of\\nyou.”\\nThe boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be\\nmore beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.\\n“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I\\nhave forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in\\nwhich men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was\\na child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful\\npresent. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”\\nThe boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the\\nhandles of her jug.\\n“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your\\ntreasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing,\\nbecause it was those omens that brought you to me. And I am a part\\nof your dream, a part of your Personal Legend, as you call it.\\n“That’s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to\\nwait until the war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before then,\\ngo on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind,\\nbut the desert never changes. That’s the way it will be with our love\\nfor each other.\\n“Maktub,” she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll\\ncome back one day.”\\nThe boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the\\nmarried shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time\\nconvincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love\\nrequired them to stay with the people they loved.\\nHe told Fatima that, at their next meeting.\\n“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,”\\nshe said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t\\nreturn become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in\\nthe ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They\\nbecome a part of everything . . . they become the Soul of the World.\\n“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy\\nbecause they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I\\nused to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I\\ntoo will be one of the women who wait.\\n“I’m a desert woman, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband to\\nwander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I\\nwill accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the\\nanimals, and the water of the desert.”\\nThe boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him\\nabout Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman\\nhad built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace,\\nfueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the\\nEnglishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than\\nthey had when he was reading his books.\\n“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out\\nthe sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It\\nwas my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master\\nWork. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago.\\nBut I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.”\\nHe continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the\\ndesert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into\\nthe desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.\\nHe wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis\\nwithin sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his\\nfeet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in\\nremote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed\\nhimself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He tried to deal with\\nthe concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t\\nseparate them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if\\nanything could help him to understand, it was the desert.\\nAs he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him.\\nLooking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.\\nHe watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their\\nflight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to\\nthe boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He followed\\nthe movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe\\nthese desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without\\nownership.\\nHe felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he\\nalso wanted to sleep. “I am learning the Language of the World, and\\neverything in the world is beginning to make sense to me . . . even\\nthe flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was\\ngrateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more\\nsense, he thought.\\nSuddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky,\\nattacking the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to\\nthe boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis.\\nThe vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had\\nheard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself:\\nthey were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over\\nthe sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t desire that an army\\ninvade the oasis.\\nHe wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation.\\nHe tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and\\nits stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn’t\\nallow him to do so.\\n“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled\\nwhat he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going\\nto occur.\\nHe rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once\\nagain, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this\\ntime, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become\\ndangerous.\\nThe camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing\\nthe sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.\\n“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”\\n“The desert fills men’s hearts with visions,” the camel driver\\nanswered.\\nBut the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching\\ntheir flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul\\nof the World.\\nThe camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew\\nthat any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history\\nof all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a\\nperson’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds\\n. . . whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with\\nhis experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn’t that those things, in\\nthemselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking\\nat what was occurring around them, could find a means of\\npenetration to the Soul of the World.\\nThe desert was full of men who earned their living based on the\\nease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They\\nwere known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the\\nelderly. Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it\\nwould be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was\\nfated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill\\nof not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already\\nwritten by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of\\nman. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the\\npresent was full of surprises, and they had to be aware of many\\nthings: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his horse? What\\nkind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The\\ncamel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers.\\nMany of them had been right about what they said, while some had\\nbeen wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out\\n(and the one most to be feared) had asked why the camel driver was\\nso interested in the future.\\n“Well . . . so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can\\nchange those things that I don’t want to happen.”\\n“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had\\nsaid.\\n“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare\\nmyself for what’s coming.”\\n“If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said\\nthe seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer\\ngreatly before they even occur.”\\n“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel\\ndriver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based on\\nthe future.”\\nThe seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on\\nthe ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. That\\nday, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth\\nand put them back in his bag.\\n“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I\\nknow the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to\\npenetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the past,\\ndiscover what has already been forgotten, and understand the\\nomens that are here in the present.\\n“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I am\\nguessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he\\nwho reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess\\nat the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here\\nin the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve\\nupon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will\\nalso be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according\\nto the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in\\nitself, brings with it an eternity.”\\nThe camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under\\nwhich God would allow him to see the future.\\n“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the\\nfuture. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future that\\nwas written so as to be altered.”\\nGod had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver\\nthought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his\\ninstrument?\\n“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver. “Tell\\nthem about the armies that are approaching.”\\n“They’ll laugh at me.”\\n“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used\\nto dealing with omens.”\\n“Well, then, they probably already know.”\\n“They’re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if\\nthey have to know about something Allah wants them to know,\\nsomeone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before.\\nBut, this time, the person is you.”\\nThe boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see\\nthe chiefs of the tribes.\\nThe boy approached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at\\nthe center of the oasis.\\n“I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the desert.”\\nWithout responding, the guard entered the tent, where he\\nremained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young\\nArab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what\\nhe had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared\\ninto the tent.\\nNight fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants\\nentered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were\\nextinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights\\nin the great tent remained. During all this time, the boy thought about\\nFatima, and he was still unable to understand his last conversation\\nwith her.\\nFinally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The\\nboy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have\\nimagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent\\nlike this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful\\ncarpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure\\nhung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The\\ntribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle,\\nresting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and\\nwent with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants\\nmaintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused\\nwith the sweet scent of smoke.\\nThere were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately\\nwhich of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and\\ngold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the\\nyoung Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.\\n“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the\\nchieftains, eyeing the boy.\\n“It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.\\n“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it\\nknows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the\\nchieftains.\\n“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy\\nsaid. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not\\nsee.”\\nAnd also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought\\nto himself.\\n“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a\\nthird chieftain.\\n“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you\\ndon’t have to do anything about it.”\\nThe men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an\\nArabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to\\nleave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens\\ntold him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to\\nthe camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.\\nSuddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and\\nthe boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the discussion,\\nand, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was\\nalready used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the\\nvibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he\\nhad been right in coming.\\nThe discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few\\nmoments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he\\nturned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.\\n“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in\\ndreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the old\\nman said, now in the dialect the boy understood. “Our merchants\\nbought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that\\nwhoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.”\\nThe elder continued, “When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that\\nwere thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued\\nEgypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in\\na strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”\\nHe paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.\\n“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from\\nfamine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of\\npeoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and\\nhow their children should marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is\\nneutral territory, because both sides have oases, and so both are\\nvulnerable.”\\nNo one said a word as the old man continued.\\n“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages\\nof the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”\\nThe old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was\\nover. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at\\nattention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke\\nagain:\\n“Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no\\none at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will\\nbe on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will\\nonce again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men\\namong our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.\\n“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms\\nare as capricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next\\ntime they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been used\\nby the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.”\\nWhen the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the\\nlight of the full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and\\nbegan to make his way there.\\nHe was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in\\nreaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for\\nhaving done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had\\nbeen making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to\\npursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to\\ndie tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day\\nwas there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world.\\nEverything depended on one word: “Maktub.”\\nWalking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died\\ntomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the\\nfuture. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait,\\nafter having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the\\nsilence of the desert and Fatima’s eyes. He had lived every one of\\nhis days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died\\ntomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds,\\nand he was proud of that.\\nSuddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the\\nground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was\\nswirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him\\nwas an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening\\nscream.\\nWhen the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what\\nhe saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in\\nblack, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban\\nand his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black\\nkerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his\\npresence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.\\nThe strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a\\nscabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in\\nthe light of the moon.\\n“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he\\ndemanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty\\nthousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.\\n“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy. He was reminded of the\\nimage of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the\\ninfidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same,\\nexcept that now the roles were reversed.\\n“It is I who dared to do so,” he repeated, and he lowered his head\\nto receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because\\nI was able to see through to the Soul of the World.”\\nThe sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until\\nthe point touched the boy’s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.\\nThe horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t\\neven occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of\\njoy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for\\nFatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-\\nface with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about\\ndying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a\\npart of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that\\nSoul.\\nThe stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead.\\n“Why did you read the flight of the birds?”\\n“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save\\nthe oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men\\nat the oasis than you have.”\\nThe sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what\\nAllah has willed?”\\n“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah\\ntaught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by\\nthe same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver’s\\nwords.\\nThe stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the\\nboy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.\\n“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. “When\\nsomething is written, there is no way to change it.”\\n“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of\\nthe battle.”\\nThe stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the\\nsword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”\\n“I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would\\nunderstand.”\\nThe stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy\\nrelaxed.\\n“I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the\\nquality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”\\nThe boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that\\nvery few people knew about.\\n“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he\\ncontinued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely.\\nBecause the desert tests all men: it challenges every step, and kills\\nthose who become distracted.”\\nWhat he said reminded the boy of the old king.\\n“If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders\\nat sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger.\\nThe same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip.\\nThe horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.\\n“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode\\naway.\\nThe hand with the whip pointed to the south.\\nThe boy had met the alchemist.\\nNext morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered\\nthroughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached\\nits high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The\\nmounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it appeared to be a\\npeaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes.\\nWhen they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum, they\\nwithdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.\\nThe men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert\\nand within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The\\nchildren had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees,\\nand saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained\\nin their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw\\nnothing of the battle, either. Were it not for the bodies there on the\\nground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.\\nThe only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion.\\nThat afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who\\nasked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said\\nthat his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many\\ndays of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to\\nreturn to the war.\\nThe tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but\\nthat the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to\\ndeath without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet,\\nhe was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the\\ndesert wind.\\nThe tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty\\npieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and\\nasked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.\\nWhen the sun had set, and the first stars made their appearance, the\\nboy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent,\\nand a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place\\ninhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.\\nNot until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He\\ncarried two dead hawks over his shoulder.\\n“I am here,” the boy said.\\n“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your\\nPersonal Legend that brings you here?”\\n“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the\\ndesert. So I have come here.”\\nThe alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the\\nboy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the\\noasis. The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus\\nused in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a\\npile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious\\ndesigns.\\n“Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,”\\nsaid the alchemist.\\nThe boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen\\non the day before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire,\\nand soon a delicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the\\nscent of the hookahs.\\n“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.\\n“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told\\nme you would be coming, and that you would need help.”\\n“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the\\nEnglishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”\\n“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has\\nbegun to try to understand the desert.”\\n“And what about me?”\\n“When a person really desires something, all the universe\\nconspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the\\nalchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood.\\nAnother person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.\\n“So you are going to instruct me?”\\n“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to\\npoint you in the direction of your treasure.”\\n“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.\\n“I know what’s happening in the desert.”\\n“I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my\\nmoney from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own\\ncountry, I would be a rich man.”\\n“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.\\n“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I\\nhave won.”\\n“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”\\nThey ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a\\nred liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had\\never tasted.\\n“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked\\n“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist.\\n“It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”\\nThe alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine,\\nhe relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under\\na moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.\\n“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the\\nboy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior\\npreparing for combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there\\nyou will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that\\neverything you have learned along the way can make sense.\\n“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are\\ntraitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire.\\nThen suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You\\nalways know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that they\\nare about to die.”\\nThe following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist’s tent with a\\nhorse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and\\nplaced the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me\\nwhere there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such\\nsigns of life are able to find treasure.”\\nThey began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their\\nway. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy\\nthought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.\\nHe wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the\\nman. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the\\nhawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.\\n“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I know\\nthat there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”\\n“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.\\nAnd then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse,\\nwho galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist\\nfollowed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could\\nno longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above\\nthem, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert.\\nSuddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.\\n“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know the\\nlanguage of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”\\nThey dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing\\nslowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped\\nabruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the\\nstones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire\\narm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the\\nalchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with\\nhis effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the\\nhole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm\\nand leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.\\nThe boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake\\nfought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of\\nthe desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in\\nminutes.\\n“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the\\nalchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been\\nbitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred years\\nold,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with\\nthe snakes of the desert.\\nThe boy watched as his companion went to his horse and\\nwithdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and\\nthen he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.\\n“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. You\\nfound life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”\\n“Why was that so important?”\\n“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.” The boy\\ndidn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he\\nhad been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his\\nsearch for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.\\n“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said.\\n“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima,\\nand, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”\\n“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She knows\\nthat men have to go away in order to return. And she already has her\\ntreasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it is you’re\\nlooking for.”\\n“Well, what if I decide to stay?”\\n“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the\\noasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels.\\nYou’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn\\nto love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty\\nthousand palms. You’ll watch them as they grow, demonstrating how\\nthe world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better at\\nunderstanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher there\\nis.\\n“Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the\\ntreasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll try\\nto ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis\\nand its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do.\\nAnd your camels will bring you wealth and power.\\n“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your\\ntreasure and your Personal Legend. You’ll walk around, night after\\nnight, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it\\nwas she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and she’ll\\nreturn your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to stay,\\nbecause a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man.\\nSo you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the\\ndesert, thinking that maybe you could have left . . . that you could\\nhave trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at\\nthe oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that\\npoint, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever.\\n“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon\\nyou, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains\\nwill see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor.\\nBut, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels and a\\ngreat deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days\\nknowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now\\nit’s too late.\\n“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing\\nhis Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it\\nwasn’t true love . . . the love that speaks the Language of the World.”\\nThe alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake\\nslithered away among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal\\nmerchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the\\nEnglishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman\\nwho had trusted in the desert. And he looked out over the desert that\\nhad brought him to the woman he loved.\\nThey mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who\\nfollowed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the\\nsounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s\\nvoice.\\nBut that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the\\nstrange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love\\nand treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal\\nLegend.\\n“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace\\nin his heart.\\n“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’s only\\nresponse.\\nThe boy spent a sleepless night. Two hours before dawn, he awoke\\none of the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him\\nwhere Fatima lived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his\\nfriend enough gold to buy a sheep.\\nThen he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was\\nsleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside.\\nThe young Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to\\nbuy yet another sheep.\\n“Now leave us alone,” said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab\\nreturned to his tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of\\nthe oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some\\nsheep.\\nFatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out\\namong the palms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the\\nTradition, but that didn’t matter to him now.\\n“I’m going away,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m coming\\nback. I love you because . . .”\\n“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because\\none is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”\\nBut the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I\\nsold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes\\ndeclared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you\\nbecause the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”\\nThe two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the\\nother.\\n“I’ll be back,” the boy said.\\n“Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,” said\\nFatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but\\nhe returned to my mother, and he has always come back since\\nthen.”\\nThey said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the\\npalms, and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent.\\n“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,” he said.\\nHe saw that Fatima’s eyes were filled with tears.\\n“You’re crying?”\\n“I’m a woman of the desert,” she said, averting her face. “But\\nabove all, I’m a woman.”\\nFatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went\\nout to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had\\nchanged. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would\\nnever again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It\\nwould no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three\\nhundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their\\nlong journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place\\nfor her.\\nFrom that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She\\nwould look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy\\nwas following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her\\nkisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s face,\\nand would tell him that she was alive. That she was waiting for him,\\na woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From\\nthat day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the\\nhope for his return.\\n“Don’t think about what you’ve left behind,” the alchemist said to the\\nboy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. “Everything\\nis written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever.”\\n“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the\\nboy said. He was already reaccustomed to the desert’s silence.\\n“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And\\none can always come back. If what you had found was only a\\nmoment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing\\non your return.”\\nThe man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy\\nknew that he was referring to Fatima.\\nIt was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The\\ndesert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy\\ncould still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman\\nhe loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the\\ncamel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the\\nalchemist has never been in love, the boy thought.\\nThe alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The\\nbird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they\\nstopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned\\nwith a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.\\nAt night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires\\nhidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and\\ndarker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week,\\nspeaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to\\navoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued, and at times\\nthe wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had been\\nfought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the\\nlanguage of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had\\nfailed to observe.\\nOn the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier\\nthan usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist\\noffered his water container to the boy.\\n“You are almost at the end of your journey,” said the alchemist. “I\\ncongratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”\\n“And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I\\nthought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A\\nwhile ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on\\nalchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”\\n“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s\\nthrough action. Everything you need to know you have learned\\nthrough your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”\\nThe boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was\\nsearching the horizon, looking for the falcon.\\n“Why are you called the alchemist?”\\n“Because that’s what I am.”\\n“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold\\nand were unable to do so?”\\n“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They\\nwere seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting\\nactually to live out the Personal Legend.”\\n“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.\\nBut the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the\\nfalcon returned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it,\\nso that the light of the flames would not be seen.\\n“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as he\\nprepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather, who\\nlearned from his father, and so on, back to the creation of the world.\\nIn those times, the Master Work could be written simply on an\\nemerald. But men began to reject simple things, and to write tracts,\\ninterpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to feel\\nthat they knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald Tablet\\nis still alive today.”\\n“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to\\nknow.\\nThe alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his\\ndrawing in less than five minutes. As he drew, the boy thought of the\\nold king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if\\nit had taken place years and years ago.\\n“This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,” said the\\nalchemist, when he had finished.\\nThe boy tried to read what was written in the sand.\\n“It’s a code,” said the boy, a bit disappointed. “It looks like what I\\nsaw in the Englishman’s books.”\\n“No,” the alchemist answered. “It’s like the flight of those two\\nhawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tablet\\nis a direct passage to the Soul of the World.\\n“The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image\\nand a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a\\nguarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the\\nworld so that, through its visible objects, men could understand his\\nspiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. That’s what I\\nmean by action.”\\n“Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.\\n“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the\\nright time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet.\\nBut you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will\\ngive you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face\\nof the earth will do that. You don’t even have to understand the\\ndesert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and\\nyou will see in it all the marvels of creation.”\\n“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”\\n“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the\\nSoul of the World, and it will one day return there.”\\nThey crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The\\nalchemist had become much more cautious, because they were\\napproaching the area where the most violent battles were being\\nwaged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.\\nIt was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been\\nready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been\\ntimes when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other\\ntimes it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy\\nhad to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy\\nof treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the\\nendless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even\\nwhen the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.\\n“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when\\nthey had made camp that day.\\n“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your\\ntreasure.”\\n“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets\\nemotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It\\nasks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when\\nI’m thinking about her.”\\n“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has\\nto say.”\\nDuring the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number\\nof armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy’s heart\\nbegan to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul\\nof the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and\\nnever succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that\\nhe might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the\\ndesert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found\\nlove and riches.\\n“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they\\nhad paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”\\n“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid\\nthat, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”\\n“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”\\n“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you\\npretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there\\ninside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about\\nthe world.”\\n“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”\\n“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your\\nheart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know\\nits dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.\\n“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to\\nlisten to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an\\nunanticipated blow.”\\nThe boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the\\ndesert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it\\nas it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to\\nthe oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was\\nhappy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m\\nthe heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are\\nafraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that\\nthey don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them.\\nWe, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go\\naway forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren’t,\\nor of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden\\nin the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”\\n“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the\\nalchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.\\n“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering\\nitself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of\\nits dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s\\nencounter with God and with eternity.”\\n“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy\\ntold his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure,\\nevery day has been luminous, because I’ve known that every hour\\nwas a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly\\nsearching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I\\nnever would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that\\nseemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”\\nSo his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy\\nslept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things\\nthat came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are\\nhappy have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a\\ngrain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a\\ngrain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken\\nmillions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that\\nawaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, seldom say much\\nabout those treasures, because people no longer want to go in\\nsearch of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply\\nlet life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But,\\nunfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to\\ntheir Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the\\nworld as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns\\nout, indeed, to be a threatening place.\\n“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop\\nspeaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard:\\nwe don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their\\nhearts.”\\n“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their\\ndreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.\\n“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t\\nlike to suffer.”\\nFrom then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please,\\nnever to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far\\nfrom his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy\\nswore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its\\nmessage.\\nThat night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist\\nunderstood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the\\nWorld.\\n“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.\\n“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.\\n“And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of\\nshowing you where the treasure is.”\\n“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”\\n“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this:\\nbefore a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything\\nthat was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but\\nso that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the\\nlessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s\\nthe point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we\\nsay in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the\\npalm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\\n“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends\\nwith the victor’s being severely tested.”\\nThe boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that\\nthe darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.\\nOn the following day, the first clear sign of danger appeared. Three\\narmed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the\\nalchemist were doing there.\\n“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.\\n“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re armed,”\\none of the tribesmen said.\\nThe alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.\\n“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he\\nhad searched the boy’s bag.\\n“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.\\nThe tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings\\nfound a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg\\nthat was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.\\n“What are these things?” he asked.\\n“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It’s the\\nMaster Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will\\nnever be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal\\ninto gold.”\\nThe Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They\\nthought his answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the\\nalchemist to proceed with all of their belongings.\\n“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had\\nmoved on. “What did you do that for?”\\n“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist\\nanswered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to\\ntell others of them, seldom are you believed.”\\nThey continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the\\nboy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to\\nknow about things of the past or future; it was content simply to\\ncontemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of\\nthe World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither\\nwas capable now of betraying the other.\\nWhen his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the\\nboy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in\\nthe desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest\\nqualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying\\nto live out his Personal Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time\\nhe had worked at the crystal shop.\\nAnd his heart told him something else that the boy had never\\nnoticed: it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that\\nhe had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden\\nthe rifle the boy had taken from his father, because of the possibility\\nthat the boy might wound himself. And it reminded the boy of the day\\nwhen he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which he\\nhad fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther\\nahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him.\\nBut, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on,\\nthinking that he had changed his route.\\n“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the\\nalchemist.\\n“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their\\nPersonal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the\\nelderly, too.”\\n“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”\\n“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.\\nOne afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the\\ntribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful\\nwhite robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their\\nhookahs and trading stories from the battlefield. No one paid any\\nattention to the two travelers.\\n“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past\\nthe encampment.\\nThe alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never\\nforget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one\\nanother, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No\\none fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”\\nAll things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert\\nwanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen\\nappeared from behind the travelers.\\n“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area\\nwhere the tribes are at war.”\\n“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight\\ninto the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and\\nthen agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.\\nThe boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated\\nthose horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.\\n“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the\\nalchemist.\\nThat’s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of\\nthe multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had\\nbeen one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away\\nthat his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain that he had\\nbeen looking at them.\\nFinally, when they had crossed the mountain range that extended\\nalong the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two\\ndays from the Pyramids.\\n“If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then\\nteach me about alchemy.”\\n“You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the\\nSoul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been\\nreserved for you.”\\n“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead\\ninto gold.”\\nThe alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy\\nonly after they had stopped to eat.\\n“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men,\\ngold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I don’t\\nknow why. I just know that the Tradition is always right.\\n“Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold,\\ninstead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for\\nconflict.”\\n“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said.\\n“There was a time when, for me, a camel’s whinnying was nothing\\nmore than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger. And, finally,\\nit became just a whinny again.”\\nBut then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all\\nthat.\\n“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They\\nlocked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold\\nhad. And they found the Philosopher’s Stone, because they\\nunderstood that when something evolves, everything around that\\nthing evolves as well.\\n“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had\\nthe gift, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of\\nothers. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.\\n“And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold.\\nThey never found the secret. They forgot that lead, copper, and iron\\nhave their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who\\ninterferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will\\ndiscover his own.”\\nThe alchemist’s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over\\nand picked up a shell from the ground.\\n“This desert was once a sea,” he said.\\n“I noticed that,” the boy answered.\\nThe alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had\\ndone that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound\\nof the sea.\\n“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal\\nLegend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once\\nagain covered by water.”\\nThey mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the\\nPyramids of Egypt.\\nThe sun was setting when the boy’s heart sounded a danger signal.\\nThey were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the\\nalchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared\\nto be unaware of any danger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two\\nhorsemen waiting ahead of them. Before he could say anything to\\nthe alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a\\nhundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.\\nThey were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding\\ntheir turbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only\\ntheir eyes showing.\\nEven from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their\\nsouls. And their eyes spoke of death.\\nThe two were taken to a nearby military camp. A soldier shoved the\\nboy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a\\nmeeting with his staff.\\n“These are the spies,” said one of the men.\\n“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.\\n“You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you were\\ntalking with one of the troops there.”\\n“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” said\\nthe alchemist. “I have no information about troops or about the\\nmovement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend\\nhere.”\\n“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.\\n“An alchemist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of\\nnature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.”\\nThe boy listened quietly. And fearfully.\\n“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.\\n“He has brought money to give to your tribe,” said the alchemist,\\nbefore the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the\\nalchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.\\nThe Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough there\\nto buy a lot of weapons.\\n“What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally.\\n“It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to,\\nhe could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”\\nThe men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and\\nknew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt\\nhis heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they\\nwere fearful of sorcerers.\\n“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.\\n“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to\\ntransform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he\\ncan’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your\\ntribe.”\\n“You can’t offer me something that is already mine,” the chief said,\\narrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days.\\nThe boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out\\nof the tent.\\n“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They\\nare brave men, and they despise cowards.”\\nBut the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after\\nthey had walked through the center of the camp. There was no need\\nto imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So,\\nonce again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the\\ndesert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was\\nan impenetrable wall.\\n“You gave them everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve\\nsaved in my entire life!”\\n“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the\\nalchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not\\noften that money saves a person’s life.”\\nBut the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He\\nhad no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He\\nwasn’t an alchemist!\\nThe alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured\\nsome on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the\\nalchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.\\n“Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely\\ngentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”\\n“But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind.”\\n“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything\\nhe needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream\\nimpossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”\\n“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn\\nmyself into the wind.”\\n“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”\\n“But what if I can’t?”\\n“Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal\\nLegend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people,\\nwho never even knew what their Personal Legends were.\\n“But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat of\\ndeath makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”\\nThe first day passed. There was a major battle nearby, and a\\nnumber of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead\\nsoldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t\\nchange anything, the boy thought.\\n“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one of\\nhis companions. “You could have died after peace had been\\ndeclared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”\\nAt the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, who\\nhad taken his falcon out into the desert.\\n“I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,” the boy\\nrepeated.\\n“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of\\nGod. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into\\ncontact with the material plane.”\\n“What are you doing?”\\n“Feeding my falcon.”\\n“If I’m not able to turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” the\\nboy said. “Why feed your falcon?”\\n“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already know\\nhow to turn myself into the wind.”\\nOn the second day, the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the\\ncamp. The sentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard\\nabout the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they\\ndidn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.\\nHe spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over\\nthe desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert\\nsensed his fear.\\nThey both spoke the same language.\\nOn the third day, the chief met with his officers. He called the\\nalchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns\\nhimself into the wind.”\\n“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.\\nThe boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous\\nday. He told them all to be seated.\\n“It’s going to take awhile,” the boy said.\\n“We’re in no hurry,” the chief answered. “We are men of the\\ndesert.”\\nThe boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the\\ndistance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on\\nliving where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that\\nhe had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew\\nonly a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an\\nEnglishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand\\npalm trees and three hundred wells.\\n“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t you\\nspend enough time looking at me yesterday?”\\n“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So,\\nwhen I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to\\nreturn to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the\\nwind.”\\n“What is love?” the desert asked.\\n“Love is the falcon’s flight over your sands. Because for him, you\\nare a green field, from which he always returns with game. He knows\\nyour rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous\\nto him.”\\n“The falcon’s beak carries bits of me, myself,” the desert said. “For\\nyears, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have,\\nand then I show him where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the\\nfact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the\\nsky, and takes away what I’ve created.”\\n“But that’s why you created the game in the first place,” the boy\\nanswered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes\\nman. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game\\nwill once again flourish. That’s how the world goes.”\\n“So is that what love is?”\\n“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the\\nfalcon, the falcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It’s\\nwhat turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”\\n“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said.\\n“But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands\\nthere is a woman waiting for me. And that’s why I have to turn myself\\ninto the wind.”\\nThe desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.\\nThen it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow,\\nbut, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the\\nwind.”\\nA breeze began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a\\ndistance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy\\ncouldn’t understand.\\nThe alchemist smiled.\\nThe wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of the\\nboy’s talk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They\\nblow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place to die.\\n“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my\\nloved one to me.”\\n“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the\\nwind?”\\n“My heart,” the boy answered.\\nThe wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called\\nthe sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east.\\nIn the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter,\\nbecause they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert,\\nand the screams of the Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond\\nthe pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came\\nfrom Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no place at all, nor\\ndid it go to any place; that’s why it was stronger than the desert.\\nSomeone might one day plant trees in the desert, and even raise\\nsheep there, but never would they harness the wind.\\n“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different\\nthings.”\\n“That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets in\\nmy travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the\\nstars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by\\nthe same hand, and we have the same soul. I want to be like you,\\nable to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away\\nthe sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman I\\nlove.”\\n“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the\\nalchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own\\nPersonal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”\\n“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said.\\n“So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and\\nthe winds.”\\nThe wind’s curiosity was aroused, something that had never\\nhappened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t\\nknow how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things the\\nwind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled\\nentire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange\\nnoises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that\\nthere were other things the wind should be able to do.\\n“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was\\nclose to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can\\ndo anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at all to\\nunderstand what’s happening, because everything happens within\\nyou, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the\\nwind helps, of course.”\\nThe wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with\\nwhat the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the\\ndesert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its\\nway around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind.\\nAnd it knew nothing about love.\\n“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking\\nof love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at\\nhaving to acknowledge its own limitations. “Maybe it’s better to ask\\nheaven.”\\n“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a\\nsandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to\\nheaven without blinding myself.”\\nSo the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with\\nsand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.\\nAt the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert\\nwere already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it\\nwas worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their\\nweapons were filled with sand.\\nOn the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and\\nsaid, “Maybe we had better end this!”\\nThey could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the\\nblue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.\\n“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.\\n“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect.\\n“I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”\\nBut he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had\\nexpressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to\\nremove them from their commands, because true men of the desert\\nare not afraid.\\n“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the\\nsun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of\\nthe World, because it’s made of love.”\\n“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World.\\nIt communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to\\ngrow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a\\nlong way from the earth—I learned how to love. I know that if I came\\neven a little bit closer to the earth, everything there would die, and\\nthe Soul of the World would no longer exist. So we contemplate each\\nother, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it\\ngives me my reason for living.”\\n“So you know about love,” the boy said.\\n“And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at\\ngreat length to each other during this endless trip through the\\nuniverse. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now,\\nonly the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one.\\nThat there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper the\\nsame as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique\\nbeing, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that\\nwrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.\\n“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.\\n“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,”\\nthe boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a\\nsixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper,\\nand lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend,\\nbut one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has\\nto transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new\\nPersonal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes\\none thing only.”\\nThe sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly.\\nThe wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with\\ngreater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.\\n“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will\\nsearch for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he\\nwas in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no\\nfurther need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.\\n“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to\\nbecome better than we are, everything around us becomes better,\\ntoo.”\\n“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun\\nasked the boy.\\n“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to\\nroam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from\\na distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and\\nimproves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I\\nthought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that\\nit was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and\\nwars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we\\nlive in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we\\nbecome better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes\\nin. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than\\nwe are.”\\n“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.\\n“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy\\nanswered.\\n“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said.\\n“But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”\\n“Then, whom should I ask?”\\nThe sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and\\nwanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its\\nlimitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the\\nLanguage of the World.\\n“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.\\nThe wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The\\ntents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals\\nwere being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at\\neach other as they sought to keep from being blown away.\\nThe boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed\\nthat the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak.\\nA current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to\\npray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a\\nprayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his\\nsheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able\\nto sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had met\\ncontinue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that\\nthe desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the\\nsigns written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths,\\nand to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He\\nsaw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space,\\nand that there was no reason or significance attached to their\\nappearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the\\nsun, nor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand\\nhad a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform\\nmiracles, or transform the sea into a desert . . . or a man into the\\nwind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design\\nthat had moved the universe to the point at which six days of\\ncreation had evolved into a Master Work.\\nThe boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it\\nwas a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was\\nhis own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.\\nThe simum blew that day as it had never blown before. For\\ngenerations thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who\\nhad turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp,\\nin defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.\\nWhen the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place\\nwhere the boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was\\nstanding next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the\\ncamp.\\nThe men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people\\nwho were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect\\ndisciple, and the chief, because that disciple had understood the\\nglory of God.\\nThe following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist\\nfarewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them\\nas far as they chose.\\nThey rode for the entire day. Toward the end of the afternoon, they\\ncame upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told\\nthe escorts they could return to the camp.\\n“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are\\nonly three hours from the Pyramids.”\\n“Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the\\nWorld.”\\n“I only invoked what you already knew.”\\nThe alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk\\ndressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in\\nthe Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter.\\n“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist\\nsmiled.\\nThey went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The\\nalchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead,\\nwhich the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the lead had\\nbecome liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow\\negg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax,\\nand added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.\\nThe mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The\\nalchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As\\nhe did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.\\n“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.\\nThe monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza\\nfor some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,”\\nthe monk said.\\n“Exactly,” answered the alchemist.\\nWhen the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it,\\ndazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no\\nlonger lead. It was gold.\\n“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.\\n“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist\\nanswered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”\\nThey returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist\\nseparated the disk into four parts.\\n“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk.\\n“It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”\\n“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,” the monk\\nresponded.\\n“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the\\nnext time.”\\nThe alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for\\nwhat you gave to the general.”\\nThe boy was about to say that it was much more than he had\\ngiven the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the\\nalchemist said to the monk.\\n“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts.\\n“Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.”\\nHe took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.\\n“This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.”\\n“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very\\nclose to it now.”\\n“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.\\n“Then why this?”\\n“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the\\nthief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I\\nbelieve in our proverbs. There’s one that says, ‘Everything that\\nhappens once can never happen again. But everything that happens\\ntwice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.\\n“I want to tell you a story about dreams,” said the alchemist.\\nThe boy brought his horse closer.\\n“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a\\ngood man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been\\nsent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a\\npoet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.\\n“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him,\\nand told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and\\nrepeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father\\nwoke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was generous,\\nand had revealed to him something any father would be proud to\\nknow.\\n“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who\\nwas about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had\\nlived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went\\ndirectly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his\\ndream.\\n“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived\\nyour life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you\\nany wish you desire.’\\n“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my\\ndream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my\\nson’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t\\nwant anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame\\nachieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as\\nhe grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my\\nson’s words.’\\n“The angel touched the man’s shoulder, and they were both\\nprojected far into the future. They were in an immense setting,\\nsurrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language.\\n“The man wept with happiness.\\n“‘I knew that my son’s poems were immortal,’ he said to the angel\\nthrough his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s poems\\nthese people are repeating?’\\n“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him\\nto a bench nearby, where they sat down.\\n“‘The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in\\nRome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But\\nwhen the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The\\nwords you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’\\n“The man looked at the angel in surprise.\\n“‘Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a\\ncenturion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants\\nfell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a\\nrabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and\\ndays in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man\\nhe was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been\\ncured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings.\\nAnd so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he\\nconverted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place\\nwhere the man he was looking for was visiting.’\\n“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the\\nrabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was\\na man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that\\nhe was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’\\n“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These\\nare the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never\\nbeen forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come\\nunder my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be\\nhealed.” ’”\\nThe alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on\\nearth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he\\ndoesn’t know it.”\\nThe boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life\\nwould be of such importance to a shepherd.\\n“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.\\n“Good-bye,” said the boy.\\nThe boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening\\navidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell\\nhim where his treasure was hidden.\\n“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the\\nalchemist had told him.\\nBut his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the\\nstory of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had\\non two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the\\nmany men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful\\nwomen, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived\\nnotions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.\\nAs he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered,\\n“Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where\\nI am, and that’s where your treasure is.”\\nThe boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the\\nstarry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.\\nThe moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the\\nappearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that\\nhorse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the\\nalchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s\\njourney in search of treasure.\\nWhen he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There,\\nilluminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert,\\nstood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.\\nThe boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making\\nhim believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a\\nking, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all\\nfor his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love\\nwould never keep a man from his Personal Legend.\\nIf he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to\\nFatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist\\ncontinued to live in the desert, even though he understood the\\nLanguage of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold.\\nHe didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The\\nboy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal\\nLegend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced\\neverything he might have dreamed of.\\nBut here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he\\nreminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has\\nbeen achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw\\nthat, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling\\nthrough the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that,\\nin Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.\\nAnother omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so,\\nhe thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone\\ncould build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that\\nhe couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.\\nThroughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but\\nfound nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since\\nthe Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled to\\ncontinue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand\\nback into the excavation. His hands were abraded and exhausted,\\nbut he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.\\nAs he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he\\nheard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were\\nto the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their\\nfaces.\\n“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.\\nBecause he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found\\nwhere his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.\\n“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the\\nother figure said. “What are you hiding there?”\\n“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.\\nBut one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the\\nhole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of\\ngold.\\n“There’s gold here,” he said.\\nThe moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and\\nin the man’s eyes the boy saw death.\\n“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”\\nThey made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the\\nsun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and\\nbleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was\\nnear.\\n“What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often\\nthat money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally,\\nthe boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And,\\nalthough his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers\\nthat he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of\\nEgypt.\\nThe man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to\\none of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anything else. He\\nmust have stolen this gold.”\\nThe boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook\\nhim and said, “We’re leaving.”\\nBut before they left, he came back to the boy and said, “You’re not\\ngoing to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so\\nstupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent\\ndream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and\\nlook for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In\\nmy dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the\\nsacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I\\nwould find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an\\nentire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”\\nAnd they disappeared.\\nThe boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids.\\nThey seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart\\nbursting with joy.\\nBecause now he knew where his treasure was.\\nEpilogue\\nThe boy reached the small, abandoned church just as night was\\nfalling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars\\ncould still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered\\nthe time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful\\nnight . . . except for the dream.\\nNow he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.\\nHe sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his\\nknapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the\\nnight in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they\\nlooked at the stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many\\nroads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to\\nshow him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of\\nrecurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the\\nking, the thief, or . . . “Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in\\nthe omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to\\nhimself.\\nHe fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He\\nbegan to dig at the base of the sycamore.\\n“You old sorcerer,” the boy shouted up to the sky. “You knew the\\nwhole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could\\nget back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come\\nback in tatters. Couldn’t you have saved me from that?”\\n“No,” he heard a voice on the wind say. “If I had told you, you\\nwouldn’t have seen the Pyramids. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”\\nThe boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his\\nshovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest\\nof Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks\\nadorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded\\nwith jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago\\nforgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children\\nabout.\\nThe boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used\\nthe two stones only once, one morning when he was at a\\nmarketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with\\nenough omens.\\nHe placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part\\nof his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king,\\nwhom he would never see again.\\nIt’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal\\nLegend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to\\nTarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy\\nwoman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he\\nthought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.\\nThe wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that\\ncame from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the\\nthreat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume\\nhe knew well, and the touch of a kiss—a kiss that came from far\\naway, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.\\nThe boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.\\n“I’m coming, Fatima,” he said.\\nAn inspirational companion to The Alchemist that invites us to live\\nout our dreams, to embrace the uncertainty of life, and to rise to\\nmeet our own unique destiny. In his inimitable style, Paulo Coelho\\npresents a collection of philosophical stories that will delight and\\nguide seekers everywhere and help bring out the Warrior of Light\\nwithin each of us.\\nWarrior of the Light\\nPROLOGUE\\n“Just off the beach to the west of the village lies an island, and on it\\nis a vast temple with many bells,” said the woman.\\nThe boy noticed that she was dressed strangely and had a veil\\ncovering her head. He had never seen her before.\\n“Have you ever visited that temple?” she asked. “Go there and tell\\nme what you think of it?”\\nSeduced by the woman’s beauty, the boy went to the place she\\nhad indicated. He sat down on the beach and stared out at the\\nhorizon, but he saw only what he always saw: blue sky and ocean.\\nDisappointed, he walked to a nearby fishing village and asked if\\nanyone there knew about an island and a temple.\\n“Oh, that was many years ago, when my great-grandparents were\\nalive,” said an old fisherman. “There was an earthquake, and the\\nisland was swallowed up by the sea. But although we can no longer\\nsee the island, we can still hear the temple bells when the ocean\\nsets them swinging down below.”\\nThe boy went back to the beach and tried to hear the bells. He\\nspent the whole afternoon there, but all he heard was the noise of\\nthe waves and the cries of the seagulls.\\nWhen night fell, his parents came looking for him. The following\\nmorning, he went back to the beach; he could not believe that such a\\nbeautiful woman would have lied to him. If she ever returned, he\\ncould tell her that, although he had not seen the island, he had heard\\nthe temple bells set ringing by the motion of the waves.\\nMany months passed; the woman did not return and the boy\\nforgot all about her; now he was convinced that he needed to\\ndiscover the riches and treasures in the submerged temple. If he\\ncould hear the bells, he would be able to locate it and salvage the\\ntreasure hidden below.\\nHe lost interest in school and even in his friends. He became the\\nbutt of all the other children’s jokes. They used to say: “He’s not like\\nus. He prefers to sit looking at the sea because he’s afraid of being\\nbeaten in our games.”\\nAnd they all laughed to see the boy sitting on the shore.\\nAlthough he still could not hear the old temple bells ringing, the\\nboy learned about other things. He began to realize that he had\\ngrown so used to the sound of the waves that he was no longer\\ndistracted by them. Soon after that, he became used to the cries of\\nthe seagulls, the buzzing of the bees and the wind blowing amongst\\nthe palm trees.\\nSix months after his first conversation with the woman, the boy\\ncould sit there oblivious to all other noises, but he still could not hear\\nthe bells from the drowned temple.\\nFishermen came and talked to him, insisting that they had heard\\nthe bells.\\nBut the boy never did.\\nSome time later, however, the fishermen changed their tune: “You\\nspend far too much time thinking about the bells beneath the sea.\\nForget about them and go back to playing with your friends. Perhaps\\nit’s only fishermen who can hear them.”\\nAfter almost a year, the boy thought: “Perhaps they’re right. I\\nwould do better to grow up and become a fisherman and come down\\nto this beach every morning, because I’ve come to love it here.” And\\nhe thought too: “Perhaps it’s just another legend and the bells were\\nall shattered during the earthquake and have never rung out since.”\\nThat afternoon, he decided to go back home.\\nHe walked down to the ocean to say goodbye. He looked once\\nmore at the natural world around him and because he was no longer\\nconcerned about the bells, he could again smile at the beauty of the\\nseagulls’ cries, the roar of the sea, and the wind blowing in the palm\\ntrees. Far off, he heard the sound of his friends playing and he felt\\nglad to think that he would soon resume his childhood games.\\nThe boy was happy and—as only a child can—he felt grateful for\\nbeing alive. He was sure that he had not wasted his time, for he had\\nlearned to contemplate Nature and to respect it.\\nThen, because he was listening to the sea, the seagulls, the wind\\nin the palm trees, and the voices of his friends playing, he also heard\\nthe first bell.\\nAnd then another.\\nAnd another, until, to his great joy, all the bells in the drowned\\ntemple were ringing.\\nYears later, when he was a grown man, he returned to the village\\nand to the beach of his childhood. He no longer dreamed of finding\\ntreasure at the bottom of the sea; perhaps that had all been a\\nproduct of his imagination, and he had never really heard the\\nsubmerged bells ring out on one lost childhood afternoon. Even so,\\nhe decided to walk for a while along the beach, to listen to the noise\\nof the wind and to the cries of the seagulls.\\nImagine his surprise when, there on the beach, he saw the\\nwoman who had first spoken to him about the island and its temple.\\n“What are you doing here?” he asked.\\n“I was waiting for you,” she replied.\\nHe noticed that, despite the passing years, the woman looked\\nexactly the same; the veil hiding her hair had not faded with time.\\nShe handed him a blue notebook full of blank pages.\\n“Write: A Warrior of the Light values a child’s eyes because they\\nare able to look at the world without bitterness. When he wants to\\nfind out if the person beside him is worthy of his trust, he tries to see\\nhim as a child would.”\\n“What is a Warrior of the Light?”\\n“You already know that,” she replied with a smile. “He is someone\\ncapable of understanding the miracle of life, of fighting to the last for\\nsomething he believes in—and of hearing the bells that the waves\\nset ringing on the seabed.”\\nHe had never thought of himself as a Warrior of the Light. The\\nwoman seemed to read his thoughts. “Everyone is capable of these\\nthings. And, though no one thinks of himself as a Warrior of the\\nLight, we all are.”\\nHe looked at the blank pages in the notebook. The woman smiled\\nagain.\\n“Write about the Warrior,” she said.\\nAbout the Author\\nPhoto by Xavier González\\nPAULO COELHO was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His own life\\nhas in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of\\nhis internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho has\\nfollowed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a\\nwriter, met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a\\ntime in which he worked at various professions, some of them\\nmaterially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling. “I always knew,” he\\nsays, “that my Personal Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to\\nwrite.” He was thirty-eight when he published his first book.\\nIn 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled\\nthrough much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe.\\nReturning to Brazil after two years, he began a successful career as\\na popular songwriter. In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by\\nthe military dictatorship then ruling in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced\\none of the defining moments of his life: he walked the five hundred–\\nplus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.\\nOn this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims from France\\nto get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he\\nachieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later\\ndescribed in The Pilgrimage.\\nPaulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning\\na foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in\\nthe end. In 1988, he published The Alchemist, a novel that explores\\nthis theme, and it launched him as an international bestselling\\nauthor. Specifically, Paulo Coelho is recognized for his powerful\\nstorytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights he blends\\nseamlessly into his parables. His books have sold over 150 million\\ncopies worldwide. A winner of numerous literary prizes, he has been\\na member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002. Paulo\\nCoelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In\\n2007, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.\\nDiscover great authors, exclusive offers, and more at hc.com.\\nAlso by Paulo Coelho\\nThe Pilgrimage\\nWarrior of the Light\\nThe Valkyries\\nEleven Minutes\\nThe Zahir\\nBrida\\nVeronika Decides to Die\\nBy the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept\\nThe Devil and Miss Prym\\nThe Witch of Portobello\\nThe Fifth Mountain\\nThe Winner Stands Alone\\nAleph\\nManuscript Found in Accra\\nThe Illustrated Alchemist\\nBack Ads\\nCopyright\\nThis book is an English version of O Alquimista, the Portuguese original edition, published\\nin Brazil by Editora Rocco Ltd.

      "Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but\n",

      "“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to\n",

      "But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.\n",
      "Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in\n",

      "by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to\n",

      "At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the\n",

      "silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all\n",
      "the world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable\n",

      "humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the\n",

      "young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.\n",
      "“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the\n",

      "“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it\n",
      "knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the\n",
      "chieftains.\n",

      "don’t have to do anything about it.”\n",
      "The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an\n",

      "the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.\n",
      "Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and\n",
      "the boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the discussion,\n",
      "and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was\n",
      "already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the\n",

It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”\\nThe merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The\\nProphet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy\\nduring our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true\\nGod. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan,\\nand be charitable to the poor.”\\nHe stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the\\nProphet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he\\nwanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.\\n“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.\\n“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the\\nmerchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a\\npilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy\\ncity of Mecca.\\n“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was\\nyoung, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start\\nthis shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca.\\nI began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave\\nsomeone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At\\nthe same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading\\nfor Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans\\nwith servants and camels, but most of the people making the\\npilgrimage were poorer than I.\\n“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed\\nthe symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of\\nthem, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had\\ntraveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more\\ntired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his\\nleather.”\\n“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.\\n“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s\\nwhat helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute\\ncrystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that\\n\\n them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis\\nand its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do.\\nAnd your camels will bring you wealth and power.\\n“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your\\ntreasure and your Personal Legend. You’ll walk around, night after\\nnight, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it\\nwas she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and she’ll\\nreturn your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to stay,\\nbecause a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man.\\nSo you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the\\ndesert, thinking that maybe you could have left . . . that you could\\nhave trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at\\nthe oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that\\npoint, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever.\\n“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon\\nyou, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains\\nwill see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor.\\nBut, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels and a\\ngreat deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days\\nknowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now\\nit’s too late.\\n“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing\\nhis Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it\\nwasn’t true love . . . the love that speaks the Language of the World.”\\nThe alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake\\nslithered away among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal\\nmerchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the\\nEnglishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman\\nwho had trusted in the desert. And he looked out over the desert that\\nhad brought him to the woman he loved.\\nThey mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who\\nfollowed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the\\nsounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s\\nvoice.\\nBut that night, as\\n\\nnesses!”\\nSeveral women dressed in black came to the well for water, but\\nthe boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s\\ninsistence. Then a man approached.\\n“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the\\nboy asked.\\n“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the\\nstrangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses\\nfrom the Koran, and moved on.\\nAnother man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small\\nbucket. The boy repeated his question.\\n“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.\\n“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to\\nmeet with him,” the boy said.\\n“If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful\\none,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even\\nthe tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only\\nwhen he consents.\\n“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try\\nto enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.\\nBut the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.\\nFinally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in\\nblack. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered\\nby a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to\\nask about the alchemist.\\nAt that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the\\nSoul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark\\neyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and\\nsilence, he learned the most important part of the language that all\\nthe world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable\\nof understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than\\nhumanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the\\nsame force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at\\nthe well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he\\nhad been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The\\nomen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the\\ncrystals and in the silence of the desert.\\nIt was the\\n\\n the tent in a semicircle,\\nresting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and\\nwent with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants\\nmaintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused\\nwith the sweet scent of smoke.\\nThere were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately\\nwhich of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and\\ngold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the\\nyoung Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.\\n“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the\\nchieftains, eyeing the boy.\\n“It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.\\n“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it\\nknows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the\\nchieftains.\\n“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy\\nsaid. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not\\nsee.”\\nAnd also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought\\nto himself.\\n“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a\\nthird chieftain.\\n“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you\\ndon’t have to do anything about it.”\\nThe men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an\\nArabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to\\nleave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens\\ntold him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to\\nthe camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.\\nSuddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and\\nthe boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the discussion,\\nand, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was\\nalready used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the\\nvibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he\\nhad been right in coming.\\nThe discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few\\nmoments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he\\nturned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.\\n“Two\\n\\n now?” asked the boy.\\n“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s\\nwhat helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute\\ncrystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible\\ncafé. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go\\non living.\\n“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re\\ndifferent from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just\\nwant to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times\\ncrossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the\\nseven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve\\nalready imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in\\nfront of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But\\nI’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to\\ndream about it.”\\nThat day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the\\ndisplay. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same\\nway.\\nTwo more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers\\ninto the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six\\nmore months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet\\nanother sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock,\\nand he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he\\nwas now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in\\nthe marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and\\nThummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him\\nas was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy\\nin his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would\\ndisembark at Tarifa as a winner.\\n“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had\\nsaid. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was\\nhis treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a\\nthief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.\\nHe was proud of himself.
